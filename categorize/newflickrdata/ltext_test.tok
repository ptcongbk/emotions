4547571244 contentment bayo and the all knowing cow i thought this shot of bayo with his bandana was vaguely western in style so i desaturated added some sepia and threw in some vignetting to give it a sandy age worn flavor the one thing i 've drawn out is the handkerchief to keep your eye interested without it the picture turns dull they called it the wild west on account of the relative sense of lawlessness coupled with a sense of vast opportunity seemingly limitless resources coupled with manifest destiny meant america was a land of grand dreams and unrealized potential but with differing goals shared immediate resources and unknown future resources it became apparent that daily interactions and the small community values you could touch and feel were all you could trust as the world opened up people must have had the impression that nothing would ever be the same again that the old laws and ways did n't simply could n't apply this was a wild west won not quickly but slowly by people with vision a propensity for structure and a sense of the importance of motivating communities and the individuals that comprise them there are those who posit that we are destined to repeat history and among them there are those who posit that it 's not that we have more or less to work with in any given period than in another rather it 's just that we allocate our resources differently in some periods they say we put our assets our time our energy toward discovery and innovating in others we recognize that we 've pushed beyond our ability to effectively manage all that 's occurring that the proportion of excitement around the new has become so large that while exciting life becomes complex and the hope that discovery once inspired becomes both more frequently realized and less frequently enjoyed and so we circle the wagons slow the rate of new idea generation take inventory and begin to put structure around all the things we know an age of certainty and clear goals takes shape eventually once we have structure we feel contentment and begin to use our resources in a third way we start harvesting existing ideas bcg might call this a cash cow period and aggregating and building into a new creative phase becoming excited again about the possibilities ahead this pattern a cycle of innovation and discovery then building structure to incorporate the new then expanded resource usage occurs repeatedly we even have inspiring names for periods gone by the renaissance the age of enlightenment the industrial age the wild west all this is fine and dandy but what most intrigues me is that for all our advancement through the ages it never gets easier because the line between quotidien and wild is ever further the line between normal and crazy ever blurrier in the same way that as a sphere expands the volume required to increase its diameter increases the more we discover the harder it is to generate proportionally equal impact to use an old saw the greater the giants upon whose shoulders we build the greater the insight required to become a giant of future generations so why do we even bother is it that we strive for something more than we see around us or is it that we do n't see an alternative to achieving personally i 'd bet on the later you might say we owe it to our descendants and our forefathers mothers and you might think we kinda sorta owe it to ourselves but when it comes down to it we do n't really have an alternative to achieving what else can we do but use what we have and by definition using what we have requires action action involves change change requires vision vision involves inspiration and well there you are at the basis for movement through the different periods

4776183136 contentment 0 0 0 two lakes trail from my journal july 0 0 my backpacking trips are n't always filled with beautiful views babbling brooks and relaxing waterfalls at times they can be hot sticky itchy and completely unforgiving but of all the places i 've hiked so far the most uncomfortable have been close to home southern indiana in the summer i can hear fireworks but only see the flash of fireflies bangs and pops but no whistles or screeches high pitched sounds dont travel as far and with the banning of fireworks within the boundaries of the hoosier national forest the night is mostly silent its july 0rd im hiking alone overnight on the sixteen mile two lakes loop trail as usual for this time of year when the sun finally sets the pyromaniacs cant wait any longer to light their fuses and blow shit up to prove their love for america the temperature is finally starting to drop from low 0s to tolerable both sweat and humidity test the old adage that teamwork can divide the work and multiply success by easily sticking my sleeping bag to my skin i put my book down and climb out of my hammock tent to brush my teeth before i fall asleep my headlamp reveals a blue tinted forest around me and illuminates the toothbrush and toothpaste in my backpack moths fly dumbly toward the light on my forehead dozens of them stick to my sweaty face and neck beating their delicate wings in a confused frenzy i swat at them pointlessly like a much less scary parody of hitchcocks quot the birds quot i turn off my light so i can brush in peace i stand barefoot and add the acoustics of teeth brushing to the nocturnal sounds of the forest the moonlit surface of indian lake shimmers between the silhouettes of trees bang bang pop more fireworks somewhere on the lake a fisherman is floating in a boat he occasionally scans the lake with his spotlight between short nicotine and tar coughing fits i briefly wonder what he would think if he saw me in the woods i could stand by the shore with an emotionless blank stare his own monochromatic blue light would illuminate me for a moment as it passes by then i 'd quickly duck into the shadows hed look back certain he saw someone standing there but never really certain of what he saw i could give him a story to tell in my opinion that is the best gift of all instead i retreat to my hammock i really have no desire to stay outside its protective mesh and get even more blood mugged by mosquitoes right before nightfall i started a fire that is now ash and embers to help keep them at bay but near the lake im sure they are in swarms a couple hundred are already flying around the forest bellies engorged with my blood my dna buzzing above me like mike teavee in willie wonkas chocolate factory with the mosquitoes cicadas are also out repeating the same relaxing mantra over and over like druids it 's relaxing but ugh what i would give for a cool breeze the only breeze ive had tonight was from the flutter of moth wings in my face fireflies are landing on the tent mesh giving me an opportunity to really study them up close from underneath even with a bit of knowledge on bioluminescence their random flashing still seems like magic at least i think its random maybe they are trying to communicate with me a message of great importance repeated over and over every summer of my life ryan you are the chosen one you must stop the reactor you 're the planets only hope the distressing part is i 'll probably never know for sure the trail is only sixteen miles long but i am intrigued by the intersecting american discovery trail the coast to coast pathway connecting the atlantic and pacific oceans i may detour back onto it for a short while just to say i ok wait that was a flash pause flash flash flash pause flash flash if there is a firefly morse code ill figure it out anyway i might take a detour on the adt it seems fitting for independence day to be on a trail that spans the whole country one of these days im going to get on it and not stop until i leap into the pacific two flashes pause then five i should note that im roughing it with pinot noir in a flask probably why im writing all this see im not insane as you may be thinking but nor am i drunk just a little wine happy ooh seven consecutive flashes wait 0 0 0 0 0 and 0 those are all prime numbers interesting cant be a coincidence yep all alone in a hammock in the woods sipping pinot noir from a metal flask with sophistication and class it would be impossible to sip it any other way hmm maybe the fireflies are trying to give me gps coordinates i should keep writing the numbers down and see where they lead me its a good a reason to travel somewhere as any right it would be spontaneous an adventure maybe ill find that reactor or something there are a lot of bug bites polka dotting my arms and legs maybe anemia is the root of my peculiar thoughts tonight they havent started itching yet but histamines are on their way to set off an inflammatory immune reaction that will irritate nerve endings all over my body causing me to itch uncontrollably i cant wait regardless of the bugs bites and humidity somehow the trip has still been worth it my time spent in the hammock listening to cicadas has been nice my backpacking trips are n't always filled with beautiful views babbling brooks and relaxing waterfalls at times they can be hot sticky itchy and completely unforgiving but i love it no matter where or when i walk into the woods i rarely fail to find a silence solitude and contentment that nothing else provides by the way i put my recordings of the firefly flashes into google earth as gps coordinates they took me to an isolated dirt road near turrah sudan screw that sorry fireflies you chose the wrong messiah

5052472574 contentment love b w susan tiger lair started the group quot tigger the gatekeeper 's garden clubhouse quot several years ago after quot meeting quot this gorgeous orange tabby when he lived at sugar mill gardens and was for all intents and purposes the unofficial mascot it was through her that i learned of tigger and on january 0 0 went to the gardens for the first time to meet him for myself i knew that susan would be out of town that day and the temps were dropping down to 0 degrees that night which is very unusual for our area with no one to check on tigger and since i 'd already become a member of his group i decided to run by and see if he had anyplace to go where he could stay warm not knowing if he 'd ever been outside in weather that cold or not before when i got there the temp was already about 0 degrees and when i found tig he was lying on top of the old ruins trying to sun himself to stay warm but already shivering i 'd brought a big pink blanket with me for him so i tossed it over the chain link fence on top of the ruin 's wall so he could get on it he looked at me suspiciously so i walked away taking pics as i went and noticing that the bushes were covered to keep them from freezing but tigger seemed to have no bedding or building to go in to keep warm when i returned from my walk i found tigger on top of the blanket looking very happy i knew susan would bring him treats which i did too so i asked him if he wanted them and he came over the fence to eat them the rest is history from that moment on i fell in love with tigger i went to the gardens at least twice a week and as time went on every day it became obvious to me that he was an older cat and the outdoor life was no longer agreeing with him i already had two cats so i did n't plan on taking tigger in but that 's how things ended up in august of 0 a major tropical storm was headed our way knowing that tigger had no shelter that would really protect him from that kind of weather and that there would be no way to get to him were the storm to intensify at the last minute i grabbed my cat carrier and got there just as they were lockiing the gates to leave him there during the storm with a bowl of food and a prayer i grabbed him and brought him home where he promptly let it be known that he loved my bed and i was n't allowed to move or disturb him or i 'd get a quot gentle quot but not so subtle claw touching my leg to warn me not to move he has slept with me ever since and though he sometimes stares longingly out the windows of my house and has gotten out twice only for a couple of minutes he seems very happy and content not to deal with mosquitos fleas ticks or raccoons not to mention rain and foul weather today susan came as she does about every month or so and brought not just tigger but all my kitties food tuna and litter because she knows i ca n't afford to care for them right now two years ago i lost my job of 0 years and right after that my mother died after 0 months of unemployment i finally landed a part time job at a used furniture store i do odd jobs as i can but can only count on about 0 a month coming in i do n't have a budget that allows me to buy groceries for myself let alone the cats and i 've gone into debt and gone without food for up to a week to feed them so susan seeing that need has continued to help us regularly sometimes even giving me a gift card so that i can eat too mostly i live on bread that i get free from my church whenever she comes it is such a blessing and i am blown away by her love and devotion to me and my pets here 's the thing that makes it even more amazing susan is allergic to cats whenever this poor woman visits she ends up with her eyes itching and sealing shut and sometimes even breaks out in hives still she loves tigger squeegee and barrymore and i think also her friend me so much that she comes anyway and here you can see that she 's loved in return my cats know her by name now and when i tell them she 's coming they get all excited and even start feuding to gain position to see who gets to be near her and pet first today barrymore and tigger sparred and barrymore claimed the ottoman so susan would pet him this is pretty neat because he usually keeps his distance from people he let her pet him for quite a while and tigger was furious and very jealous and quite vocal about the whole thing so susan had to move across the room where tigger could have her all to himself here you can see how happy and contented he was to have his other mom petting him to learn more about tigger and his illustrious past which really is quite interesting visit my set quot all for tigger quot there you will see my first photos of him on his pink blanket and see him in sugar mill gardens you can also see his pics from when he first came to my home and how comfy he was from the get go anyone who has been following tigger 's story and who wants to help out with his or his brother 's vet care please contact me my kitties are all seniors now and eventually will need more care than i can afford to give them now it 's a sad state of affairs these days and i never figured things would be this tough for this long but i 've made a commitment to my furry charges to care for them for the rest of their little lives and am not above asking for help to do that they unlike us ca n't understand why they hurt or why there 's not enough food fortunately susan has made sure they have n't gone hungry for a long time but i 'd like to ease her burden a bit too so if you can help i 'd be grateful i will be posting more pics from this visit and afterwards when the boys were all worn out from vying for attention thanks again susan for doing so much for us for so long god willing things will improve soon and you can just visit empty handed

5588577494 sadness debris piled on white car fringe of tsunami ishinomaki higashi matsushima yamoto japan earthquake tsunami miyagi 0 it took me a lot longer than i had expected to get these pictures up from last weekend but it 's been hard to find time between my job and volunteering taking pictures just has not been the most important thing for me at this point but nevertheless i will continue squeezing the shutter whenever i can hopefully we will all be able to see dramatic transformation of these areas back into their original beauty but it is clearly a long road ahead if you live in the area and wish to help please contact me and i will send you a list of volunteer centers throughout miyagi as well as a list of important equipment to bring with you if you do decide to volunteer please go with an organized group and bring the necessary equipment i do n't mean to frighten anyone but i was notified again today that there still are dangerous areas do n't go alone please here is a video that i took of the area the same day i took these pictures www youtube com watch v cazswzd0o the area that these pictures were taken was utterly obliterated by the tsunami after a few hours of hauling items back and forth between my friends ' destroyed home i started to get a headache and feel sick from the fumes in my last post i also mentioned that i had heard of people setting off explosions and starting fires from trying to light their cigarettes we worked amidst pure devastation for about 0 hours however we were only able to salvage a handful of their things sometimes it was hard to know what was theirs since the tsunami had swept a whole city worth of belongings through the first floor of their home surprisingly the four year old house was in pretty good shape despite the fact that it was blown back off of its foundation about 0 feet and sat about 0 0 degrees off of level in the video i said 0 feet but i meant to say 0 meters the distance and angle is still a total guess but you can judge for yourself in the pictures video the structure of house was in such good condition that we were able to walk up to the second floor and salvage most of the dry smaller items their daughter was just given a brand new bed and desk set as an elementary graduation present but we unfortunately could not take it out the reason we needed to go and salvage what we could as quickly as possible was because the house although it did not look like it was sitting in the middle of a road the city and self defense force had given them only a few more days to clear out before they would have to bulldoze it down i asked the family if they had tsunami insurance but apparently there is no tsunami insurance they will receive a small amount of money from the government but it will not even come close to covering the damage they sustained the most dumbfounding part of that day for me was not surreal experience of walking through the total destruction of an entire town but rather the laughing and smiling that came from a family who just lost everything everything except each other items and worldly possessions are of little value against the people we hold dear i tried to reciprocate the smiles laughter and healthy conversation especially in light of the children but it was n't easy fighting off the grim emotions lurking below the surface this last weekend i was able to volunteer for a short time in downtown ishinomaki and also take a few more pictures video the downtown area seems to be getting a lot more attention and about half of the roads seem traversable downtown also felt incredibly safe during the day time due to the dozens of police and military both japanese and us walking the streets and distributing food and water at the camps i will post those pictures later this week i know my website is in shambles right now i just have not had time but i 'm hoping to have it looking nicer as soon as possible i 've never really sold anything from my website but i 'm going to donate all of the money i earn from any of the pictures i sell not just the quake photos to red cross japan for at least the next year please take it into consideration here is my site www carstenknoche com in addition i contributed many of my pictures to quakebook org and if you have never heard this organization please check them out as well all of quakebook 's revenue will also go towards the red cross japan www quakebook org lastly you can contribute directly to red cross japan here www jrc or jp english relief l0 vcms0 0 html thank you very much for facing this tragedy with us with cooperation strength and perseverance we can accomplish anything take care carsten knoche

9547655270 disgust catacombs catacombs montparnasse paris i decided that today was a day for going underground and i set off to montparnasse to visit the catacombs these are a vast maze of tunnels under paris originally used for quarrying the stone out of which the city 's main buildings are constructed in the late 0th century the state of the city 's churchyards had become so disgusting that the city removed the bones from all of them they were brought here at night the carts coming from the centre of the city accompanied by torch bearing acolytes and priests chanting the requiem mass a skull count showed that almost six million corpses were removed in this way they were buried deep underground but these people being parisians the skulls and bones were arranged in a neat and methodical way a meaningful chaos layers of tibia and femurs are crowned by a layer of pelvises and skulls and so on each churchyard was grouped together and a plaque shows which parish provided the skeletons the work was interrupted by the french revolution which provided plenty more corpses for when the work was resumed altogether about a kilometre and a half of tunnels were filled with the remains of dead parisians and you can walk through them on a winding route under the streets around montparnasse station in fact this is just a tiny fraction of the tunnels the catacombs extend for hundreds of kilometres under the city many of them rarely explored and difficult of access because of this they are regularly broken into by intrepid adventurers and many legends have grown up about parts of the network however my favourite story is one which is true in 0 a group of police cadets on a training exercise were given the task of tracking an imaginary criminal in a part of the network which was little known they got into the system through a manhole and when they were about a hundred feet underground something rather odd happened they triggered a motion sensor which set off the sound of barking dogs thinking that it was part of the exercise they headed onwards only to come out into a vast cavern which had been fully equipped as a cinema an anteroom had been equipped and fully stocked as a bar and there was also a film storage room when the cadets reported what they had seen the electricity board were sent in to work out where the invaders were getting their electricity from instead they found the wires all cut the equipment removed and a sign saying 'do n't try to follow us you 'll never find us ' perhaps the cineastes had got fed up with waiting to get into the system officially because this was the only place all week that i encountered a serious queue worse i was just in front of a small group of people who talked constantly in very loud voices she was an american who obviously lived in paris and they appeared to be young relatives who 'd come to stay she was taking them down the catacombs and the price to be paid for this by the poor kids was to suffer her pretentious nonsense she went on about spirituality and homeopathy and psychoanalysis and the inner energy and so on fair play to the kids they responded enthusiastically enough and then she got out some of her stream of consciousness poetry and started reading it in a loud voice well goodness me i was put in mind of something the graphic artist alan moore said when he was in hollywood helping turn his 'v for vendetta ' into a film and he was asked at a director 's lunch why he lived in northampton england quot because it keeps me grounded quot he replied and i thought that this was exactly right it was like the opposite of this pompous woman although to be fair to her i expect that if i went to live in paris i would also disappear up my own backside the catacombs are brilliant worth every minute of the queuing time worth every insufferable stream of consciousness adjective and then i went and did some shopping you can read my account of my travels at pariswander blogspot co uk
