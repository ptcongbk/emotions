2272304646 contentment 0 0 minutes explore 0 alternate title if you ca n't jump on the bed in a hotel where can you wow wow wow what a year i do n't think all of my years have been so full of change so the one i decide to document makes up for it hey i decided to start 0 for a few reasons one to pick up my camera every day i bought my nikon d0 in the summer of 0 and used it oh maybe 0 times for real i have always loved photography and bought the camera to try to have better equipment but i did not know how to use it and i got frustrated and my little p amp s was easier to carry around i also did it to try to improve upon my creativity taking a photo of the same subject for 0 days straight can get pretty boring lastly i did it for the simple reason of keeping a journal of my year of sorts when my 'year ' started i was living in florida miserable and traveling to nyc most every weekend i had been seeing someone there but then we broke up but i fell in love with the city met new friends and decided to move there even with all the travel my life was definitely missing something and i was feeling like i was getting old and would never have the things in life i wanted namely happiness and contentment i was getting excited with the prospect of moving i did n't really have a quot plan quot but i have often been the type of person to act on instinct and sometimes not plan well enough it usually works itself out i do n't want to miss a chance of something that could be it then a wrench got thrown in my plans there was this guy i saw around on some of my contacts contacts then he popped up during my friend hilary 's quot international tootsie pop week quot there was just something about him i mean yeah the obvious hotness but all the other similarities being vegetarian having a big dog loving the outdoors and the mountains same political religious moral views and so much more but he was married and lived in denver denver hmm in 0 i was debating a move to denver my friend chris lived in boulder for many years and loved it and wants to come back to co so badly but his wife does not he knew i was miserable in fl i wanted to go somewhere and while i love and miss portland oregon dearly where i lived between ca and fl my ex husband is there so i wanted to find a new place to live denver was sounding promising but then i met the guy in nyc blah blah blah i started thinking about denver again nyc was still 0 choice but i also knew there was a huge chance i would be living off of top ramen daily if i was lucky i decided i would still keep my options open and i decided i would get to know this flickr due because well it is nice to have friends in new cities right and he never seemed to talk about his wife and then i saw no wedding ring where i saw one before so i thought maybe i was mistaken about him being married and if nothing else his photography was some of the best i had seen a little bizarre at times and by a little i mean a lot but still captivating but then as my brother would say it was my lucky day i discovered that this hott denver guy was single i mean not that he would ever want me he did n't even know who i was if you look at his flickr stream he had about 0 give or take 0 women daily commenting on how hot and wonderful and funny and amazing and and and and and that he was i was sure he had no shortages of dates so i decided to contact him i mean it seemed weird but rejection over the internet has got to be easier than face to face right so i decided to ask him about colorado and he responded back and he told me some things but then i saw that the conversation could die quickly so i just kept making up reasons to talk to him and he kept talking back flickrmails turned into emails which turned into gchats which turned into phone calls which turned into him doing a hell of a lot of research to find out where i worked and sent me flowers to me which led to me with a few other things in between deciding to take a chance and move there before i even met him in person we finally did meet in person 0 days before i was to officially move or i moved 0 days after i left his house i was so scared i wanted to crawl in a hole i was so scared he would not like me or think i was boring or stupid or whatever and the moment i saw him i just knew there were so many things that i worried about his ex wife the fact that he had kids i always wanted kids but i had never dated anyone with kids and i remember what a brat i was to the people my mom dated the fact i was moving across country with a big part of it being for the guy i had actually decided i should plan of it and save some money and all that jazz and i ended up finding a job opening with my company like 0 0 weeks after entertaining the idea of moving at all and you know a million other things but the moment i saw him i just knew that none of it mattered and if there was any issues they would work out nothing had ever felt more right than being there with him the fact i had to go 0 days before seeing him again was torture i knew i was in love with him then and there though i certainly did not mention that fact for a couple months as i did not want to scare him off but hey when you know you know and honestly i do n't know how some of these other flickr couples do it 0 days before he flew to jacksonville to come get me and drive across country with me and it was the longest of my life but i am here now and with him and we are living together and we have already had a lot happen but when he is there it is all okay he is completely absolutely the one for me and i have never felt so strongly about this ever not even when i was married before a lot happened besides that but i wanted to focus on that because it is such a huge part of my year and where i am today and where i will be in the future i moved twice once across country and once in town from my apartment i rarely saw to his house i got fired from my job of 0 years my father died dave 's beautiful sweet awesome 0 year old dog died i started a new job i went from having a single life to having a boyfriend which also came with 0 kids an ex wife with a new husband all her family not to mention his family i adore his family which is important to me and then of course there is the everyday stuff some good some bad i met some flickr friends who now to me are simply friends not 'flickr friends ' and i adore them so much brigid rachel jessi james we got 0 dogs together and of course i learned about myself improved upon my photography and editing and became truly passionate about a hobby i always wanted to indulge in but never felt i was good enough and of course thank you to all of you who have been so supportive this last year i mean it sometimes it is hard to keep going without support and now i am going to stfu because we are in vegas and i need to go have some fun with dave as of now i have not decided if i willdo a year 0 or take a break or continue on with yip and include sp's i do not know if i will start tomorrow or take a few days weeks off i guess we will see how i feel tomorrow oxoxoxo tara 0 random facts about me 0 when i first discovered dave on flickr and started to learn more about him through his photos and the rare time he let in on his personal life he was married but i did not know he was in the process of a divorce so since i thought he was taken i thought to myself quot this is the kind of man i want to marry since this seemingly awesome guy is taken i hope i find a guy exactly like him because he seems like everything i could ever want in a partner quot this is 0 truthful and maybe a little weird but i just knew a person like him if not him himself was the one for me i could feel it and i knew if i had a guy like him i would have my soulmate if there is such a thing now i know there is such a thing i have never felt anything like it but when you know you know and no we are not married i have had many friends family and coworkers ask me if this is why we were coming here for 0 days and there are no plans to do it now or in the future but i can tell you i am not going anywhere so and this part i was not going to do but for dave because he is such a stats geek total days 0 0 days missed depends on you you look at it on day 0 i was in nyc and completely forgot to take one so i made this one up i did have a pretty fun night and apparently i missed day 0 completely but the thing is i know i took one that day i know it that was back when i was lazy and took a lot of webcam shots if i did not feel like messing with the camera so i am guessing i accidentally deleted it boo photos where dave guest starred 0 day i got up the nerve to first talk to dave day 0 day i met dave in person day 0

2339461418 contentment be who you are be who you are there was a young rabbit named jonah who lived in the tall grass of a split rail fence row every evening he would sit at the edge of the green field and eat then he would run across the field as fast as he could jump into the woods twirl around and run back to his place in the tall grass one evening as he was eating he saw a magnificent deer with large antlers come out of the woods and stand at the edge of the field he had heard the older rabbits talk of this animal but had never seen one that night jonah decided that he wanted to become a deer he could think of nothing else so one morning he said goodbye to his family and friends and went into the woods several days later he found the deer and began to follow him he even tried to prance and pretended he had antlers after some time had passed jonah actually began to believe he was a deer one day a group of hunters with their dogs came into the woods and suddenly the deer bolted and ran jonah tried to follow but though he was a fast runner he could not keep up he saw the deer stop and then leap across a fast moving stream knowing he was a good jumper jonah leaped with all his strength but fell into the rapids and was swept downstream finally he washed up onto a rock near the shore and pulled himself to safety but not before almost drowning as he sat on the rock thinking about what had happened he realized he was not a deer and became very sad a few minutes later he saw a squirrel running through the trees playing the more he watched the more he realized how much fun the squirrel was having he decided thats what he wanted to be he ran to greet the squirrel and they played chasing each other through the woods jonah liked being a squirrel because they seemed to play all the time but after awhile jonah realized that he could not climb trees though he tried and that the nuts the squirrel ate were too hard on his teeth sadly he said goodbye and went deeper into the forest jonah loved all the things he was learning he had many experiences and saw many beautiful places he tried to be just like every animal he met believing he was their kind even his mortal enemy the fox but after several years jonah became very confused early one spring morning while sitting under a large oak tree he remembered the wide green fields and the tall grass along the fence row and the other rabbits he had left suddenly he longed to be there he thought about the fresh green clover and the sunshine his place along the fence row and his best friend the old wise rabbit so looking around the beautiful forest and thinking about all he had learned he said goodbye and ran toward the green field after running all day jonah arrived at the edge of the green field just as the sun was setting he paused taking a deep breath smelling the spring scent of new grass he leaped for joy high in the air and ran across the field toward his place when he went into the tall grass he found that his place was still there though in need of some repairs the next morning jonah hopped out to the edge of the field to sit in the sunshine when his friends and family saw him they ran and greeted him warmly there were many new rabbits that jonah did not know the rest of the day was spent sitting in the tall grass and talking with everyone jonah discovered that many of the rabbits had also left to live in other places one at the edge of a pond on a nearby farm another in a barn with soft hay and yet another on a hillside full of briars where he felt protected but unlike him they had not become confused about who they were he also discovered that the rabbits he did not recognize were from places he had heard about but could only hope to visit so it was decided by all the rabbits that in the evenings they would gather in a circle in the green field and tell of their experiences the places where they had lived and visited and what they had learned the old wise rabbit would be in charge of the conversations so that everyone did not talk at once he would call on someone to start and then everyone would have a chance to speak all those who had left shared about what their lives had been like when they were gone returning because they missed the tall grass and their places the new rabbits had come from far away and decided to live in the tall grass after visiting for awhile jonah thought them fascinating because they told of things he had never imagined so each evening the wise old rabbit would call on someone to start the conversation jonah soon found that this had become his favorite part of the day he looked forward to hearing the stories and learning many new things he realized that what all the other rabbits had done and thought was so interesting that he could sit for the rest of his life in the evening circle he also knew that some would leave for new places but others would visit and some would stay later that night unable to sleep jonah sat in the tall grass and looked at the twinkling stars it was a cold clear winter night and the wind was blowing above his head suddenly a warm feeling came over and through his body and he was filled with joy and contentment for the first time he knew for certain that he was a rabbit and that he loved being a rabbit he knew he was born to run mbarlew note i want to thank all of my dear flickr friends who take the time to visit and share your life and your stories i can sit for the rest of my life listening to you in quot the evening circle quot

3504251636 disgust a blue cookie the bus ride from shenzhen to enping was long like watching a freight train chug by except it doesn't we had to have been on that bus for seven hours sometimes napping and at times staring out our windows looking at a world standing still traffic was not only a nightmare but also a mystery for as many instances in which we could plainly see another egregiously bad vehicular accident that which has become commonplace ubiquitous in chinese travel culture there were other inexplicable stops in movement when all of a sudden as though finishing a swift countdown our speed dropped so precipitously as to let out a collective lurch if not in body then definitely in mind calvin thankfully in his perspicacity in his wide angled unique view of things saw beyond the myriad vehicles which lay unmoving as if rocks on a dry riverbed view the periphery he bade us and when we looked to the edges of the road indeed we witnessed the most peculiar instigator of traffic congestion in the world men en masse pissing on the side of the road men taking leaks creates a domino effect that one sees another enjoying the relief of an unburdened easy bladder so seductive a yoke that the only retort to the entreaty of this blissful state is to join in with abandon and impunity and so soon as the last few shakes are made back into the cars do these men go and a few hasty minutes later traffic flows again mike wanted to stop at a village so we exchanged an increasingly crowded highway for a narrow cement road on which we ventured into the dense verdure having reached an impasse in the road soon thereafter and not knowing how to advance further to actually enter the village proper we saw two lovely young ladies saddling a moped motoring towards us they then suddenly broke and turned off our path and onto a dirt one which squeezed through two homes as though a mouse through its diminutive hole that was our key we greeted them as the girls turned their heads offering us inquisitive yet gentle looks they would be our guides into town blue showed me around her neighborhood together we walked along bumpy corridors and peered through open windows beyond flitting cobwebs to lay eyes on rooms where nowadays only impenetrable shadows repose she and i examined the perfunctory red banners which framed each door in the village and subsequently hit it off when i began inquiring into the nature of those two swarthy demons who hung menacingly before the closed doors their gazes insidiously wild drunk with rage perhaps indeed later in the quietude of a sunset raining down on us while standing by ourselves in front of the village hall i finally shared my faith with her and in return she declared the lack of her own her cousin and older sister however do know jesus she said which verily warmed my heart if not hers we left the village with much rapidity but not before i blessed and encouraged blue 's cousin in whose arms a smiling babe lay and received joyfully a delectable departing gift mysterious quot blue cookies quot the official chinese name is whose mottled homely complexion would disgust if not for the sweetness an amalgam of sugar peanuts and herbs buried inside a treasure which would be discovered again and again on our tour the food around enping epitomizes i believe guangdong cuisine inexpensive and egregiously non spicy for what they lack in price and incendiary acidity however these dishes more than compensate with copious amounts of oil salt and sugar mixed together for a tantalizing effect on the taste buds our group was fortunate enough to have frequented several guangdong style dai pai dongs whose victuals both nourished our bodies and replenished our wallets it 's amazing to consider how 0rmb can feed 0 ravenous cantankerous when hungry christian bikers in fact the feasting grew exponentially more enjoyable as journey progressed as our two primary orderers began to refine their culinary acuity accurately predicting what would invigorate and excite our collective palate it helped too that our utensils were pretty clean for chinese standards our first evening we secured accommodations in a building that was not so much a hotel or even a motel as a grey dry concrete edifice in which hardwood beds were arrayed neatly in each room the spartan conditions dismayed some including myself at first however thankfulness trumped peevishness and the realization that in the middle of nowhere we had mosquito nets to ward off the inexorable squad of mozzies and one bathroom with boiling water for a very very scalding shower was more than enough to placate everyone especially after a hard day of riding besides austerity succors the soul we even managed to sleep pretty soundly without mattresses in my somnolent state i only remember shifting desperately maybe six or seven times it was a good night and a bargain at only 0rmb per person on the second day our group dared to test itself on an unknown avenue consequently we were spared the sonorous alarms of gigantic indomitable trucks and instead subjected ourselves to the vicissitudes of off road biking whose soundtrack undoubtedly for the day was provided by an orchestra of buzzing cicadas accompanied at times by the rumbling tympani of motorbikes oh the countryside was lush beautiful verdure all around a feast for the romantic soul yet for one of my companions the environment was anything but endearing for her adeptness at handling the desultory trail she surely felt was more chaotic than controlled she persevered nonetheless pushing through her disconsolation to conquer the race marked out for her such tenacity that only the father could supply and that left me thoroughly impressed at lunchtime the evangelization effort began in earnest it started innocently enough as i asked a group of girls about the secondary school down the dusty road from our restaurant then on cue the spirit whose pacing can only be described as frenetic whose rhythm is beyond my comprehension overwhelmed and took over leanne and i brought those three girls to christ while tim was assiduously preaching by our side to a band of boys who had gathered to look on and behind us ah cheung had cajoled five boys to form a circle hand in hand for prayer many people came to know jesus that hour there was undoubtedly some serious fire falling down on us we made a pit stop at the tam clan village it was another bucolic community replete with idling boys young and old and those two duplicitous demons standing watch from steady doors which it appeared held together together the ramshackle walls beside them an electricity meter evinced the reality of life in the village of a living community that flows flittingly in and out of the houses as though cats leaping over canals because i for one could n't see how hundreds of people somehow resided inside those homes when i could n't spot a single one during my brief tour of the grounds in the open by our bikes there were conspicuous signs of life however i was standing in the sun letting its warm rays melt on my skin when a young man not even twenty approached and asked me about our intents and purposes on what was once such a dull afternoon his curiosity got the better of me and together we broached a conversation in faith simon joined us and although he whom i named henry told us in his obstinacy that he depends on himself alone i feel as though a small seed of faith was still planted within him may it bloom at the appointed time when he most needs it at last inside the unlit store where we shared our gleaming hopes and fantastic dreams simon and i noticed to our surprise and delight two blackboards on which the shopkeeper had written the alphabet for english as well as for putonghua pinyin besides the letters numbers too had been painstakingly etched into the board each meticulous stroke perfectly formed so they ironically were learning that which continues to elude their more economically mobile brethren in hong kong despite their most humble upbringing i encouraged henry to pursue this knowledge since as the cliche most rightly states english and putonghua these days opens up a world of opportunity china it seems to me is one interminable housing start being carried on the shoulders of giants behemoths really an armada of green and blue dump trucks on whose backs are the physical manifestation of the hopes and dreams of billions timber stone and coal were an inescapable part of our three day trek they blew passed us literally horns afire and if you stared into the eyes of the drivers high above on those mechanized elephants you would see the glee with which they pounded both the road and the eardrums of those unwitting peons foolish enough to be nearby china and china mobile whose stores we uncovered even in the most remote suburb might i add still has much growth left and the transportation and infrastructure industries i 'm sure shall assiduously work to keep it that way my recommendation keep investing in china visiting the hot springs had been on our agenda since the inception of the trip we eventually had our chance the second evening when we raced down a wending hill to our hotel a real hotel our excitement reverberated in the air crackling with laughter and shouting choosing to swim first and foremost we left dinner to wait and hurried across the street the resort was packed with other like minded people dressed in swimming costumes that should have left more to the imagination the temperature of the pool water varied from tepid in one enclosure to skin searing in another and for one marvelous hour we swam and frolicked like little children again delighting in some wet fun a suitable reward for one more arduous day spent on the dusty dry land we capped the end of a successful day with a bang the girls oddly enough were furtive pyromaniacs in our midst longing in secret to raid the fireworks shop at the base of the hotel so after our meal they raced into the cool evening air and we could only endeavor to follow them in their explosive folly inside the store all sorts of bombastic devices were on display from the unwieldy block of chicago bull to the sleek spears adorning the wall whose warheads no doubt could just so easily take out a few eyes as mercilessly rip the pitch black from the wall of night sky the ladies suffered to leave no type of firework untouched by the flame quickly purchasing an arsenal of rainbow inducing rockets and slim sparklers to make any pyrotechnic maven proud outside we went at length the bombs burst in the air and laughter abound so much as we watched the brilliance of chinese engineering on display with the girls ' scintillating stock depleted we finally collected ourselves and headed upstairs for one more day of wonderment there was one last village to visit before we reached our final destination of enping city as we sped into the shanty community we knew something was amiss because unlike our other entrances into villages during which residents would emerge in droves to glimpse us it seemed as though these villagers preferred the comfort of their own veiled homes to the company of a few ebullient strangers it was an ominous setting in which we found ourselves one characterized by inhabitants rather mistrustful than gregarious and affable nonetheless we dispersed to share kindness and mercy to that end i approached a young lady a mere 0 years old who had her three month old boy on her shoulder and her three year old son who was without pants might i add preferring to wave them in the air like a terrible towel by her side we spoke briefly about her hopes and dreams which she says rest in the well being of her sons and then leanne and i blessed her that was the end of our village experience in china to be around people who sharpen you as iron sharpens iron that verily is a joy the villagers were simple warm and welcoming my teammates were jocular presumptuous and faithful and i in the midst of this confluence this mosaic of personalities philosophies hopes and dreams could only seek to love especially in one of my more pensive moments the trip tested my patience and tolerance my ability to accept others for who they are each a flawed creature like myself ultimately so much as we seek the men of peace everywhere we go we individually must become men of peace too a true disciple of jesus runs that race and appreciates his grace which shall always be enough in this life

3662142106 disgust burger king poutine i 've been craving for a decent poutine here in manitoba for almost a year now i 've tried many various places new york fries a amp w and various sit down restaurants throughout manitoba none of them have came anywhere close to a poutine that 's found in quebec city i had the munchies for poutine today so i tried out the poutine from burger king i generally do n't mind burger king i do love a good flame broiled whopper how was the poutine if you 're not that hungry then this poutine is for you compared to poutines at new york fries or most other places i 've visited to this poutine would be concidered a small or by chez ashton in quebec city une bb poutine the fries are the usual burger king fries the fries that werent covered in the gravy sauce were cold and obviously have been sitting out for a while but the fries that were in the gravy sauce they were soggy and burn your mouth the gravy has a very soupy salty taste to it that 's very comparable to a amp w 's poutine gravy not good what so ever it tastes like that the fries and cheese is just swimming in an almost chicken noodle soup like meal the curds were very cheddary compared to the usual cheese curd but you know what for once a restaurant is actually using curds instead of shredded cheese they did n't have the quot fresh squeak quot sound to it like in quebec or if you buy curds in the grocery store but i 'm glad they used curds none the less however the curds were mostly melted to the point that it was one pile of cheesy gooey mess already part of the fun in eating a poutine is biting into the squeaky cheese while burger king 's poutine is slightly better than a amp w 's but not by much it 's not a poutine i will ever buy again here in manitoba the best poutine i have ever had is from new york fries pretty sad huh for those here in manitoba who want to try making their own homemade poutine many grocery stores across the province including sobeys giant tiger and safeway sell fresh cheese curds from local cheese company bothwell cheese i have used their curds for a homemade poutine before and it 's always a delight you can even order them online here

3706677846 disgust female earwig with prey found during a night hike in danum valley field centre sabah province borneo to a lot of people earwigs tend to provoke disgust or a feeling of unease however this is less due to the mythology that they crawl into the ears and chew into the brain and more to do with the fact that they are typically found in places which we are inherently uncomfortable around that is to say compost heaps under wood or bricks and other warm and humid places their scuttling behaviour and menacing pincers hardly endear them any further despite people 's aversion they are rather innocuous insects with only some causing damage to crops or flowers earwigs display strong photophobic tendencies retreating back into the darkness when exposed to light consequently they are predominantly nocturnal their morphology supports this lifestyle flattened muscular bodies enabling them to wedge into cracks and crevices however they leave behind the safety of shelter when dusk descends whereupon they begin foraging diet is largely omnivorous however some species may be more inclined towards either carnivory or herbivory in the former case the long cerci pincers are used to catch and kill their prey earwigs typically live one year during which time they undergo 0 moults their sexual identity becomes apparent towards the second moult when the shape of the cerci can be used as a sexual determinant curved cerci for males and straight ones for females nevertheless some species may show other dimorphisms as previously mentioned the cerci function to catch prey but they can also be used for defense assuming a curled up posture when feeling threatened a more benign purpose though is to help fold their wings under the elytra tegmina and for use in mating rituals perhaps the caring parental habits of females will help to assuage people 's discomfort around dermapterans females lay between 0 0 eggs and vigorously defend them until they hatch during this period females clean the eggs assiduously to prevent fungal colonization of her brood when the young do hatch the female feeds her young by regurgitating food for them and continues providing care until around the second instar stage when the young are capable of fending for themselves though survival is far from assured as young earwigs have to contend with many predators ranging from amphibians and reptiles to arachnids and parasitic tachinid flies

3791687309 sadness quot it seems to me that almost all our sadnesses are moments of tension which we feel as paralysis because we no longer hear our astonished emotions living because we are alone with the unfamiliar presence that has entered us because everything we trust and are used to is for a moment taken away from us because we stand in the midst of a transition where we can not remain standing that is why the sadness passes the new presence inside us the presence that has been added has entered our heart has gone into its innermost chamber and is no longer even there is already in our bloodstream and we do n't know what it was we could easily be made to believe that nothing happened and yet we have changed as a house that a guest has entered changes we ca n't say who has come perhaps we will never know but many signs indicate that the future enters us in this way in order to be transformed in us long before it happens and that is why it is so important to be solitary and attentive when one is sad because the seemingly uneventful and motionless moment when our future steps into us is so much closer to life than that other loud and accidental point of time when it happens to us as if from outside the quieter we are the more patient and open we are in our sadnesses the more deeply and serenely the new presence can enter us and the more we can make it our own the more it becomes our fate quot rainer maria rilke

4593645913 contentment the tribute i gave here is the tribute i gave at mom 's funeral during my trip in early april mom amp i had a chat about what she wanted for her funeral she said she wanted it to include family stories and have some gospel principals i felt fine talking about family stories i felt i should defer to others speakers who were active in mom 's church for the religious comments i jotted down some notes during the layover on my return flight to north carolina when i got the phone call a week later saying mom was in a coma i felt i needed to write a draft of the talk while i had access to my pc at home i did not have a problem with the beginning of the talk i had too many stories for the middle of the talk i could not figure out how to end the talk when i arrived in utah after mom 's death i learned that one of the speakers who was going to give the more religious talk was unexpectedly out of the country that meant my talk would be longer than i had anticipated but i still needed to cut out a few of the family stories i decided to add a few spiritual beliefs that i shared with mom even though i am not a church goer i continued to struggle with how to end the talk i wrote several versions but something seemed to be missing i woke up at 0 0 a m the day of the funeral and had some thoughts on how to end the tribute i did not go back to sleep i finally got up a little after 0 0 a m ate breakfast and drove to antelope island state park to mentally compose the ending of my talk i had not shot any photos since arriving in utah five days earlier this was the last photo i took as i drove on the causeway across the great salt lake back to my brother 's home i put my thoughts in writing re read them silently and then aloud to myself and felt that mom would be satisfied i have edited out the surnames in the following posting since i mention a number of people in the talk thus it may be a bit awkward to read i am also adding some photos from the digital photo display we had at the viewing i had never seen many of the older photos so they have that much more meaning to me i 'll make this posting private in a few days please do not fave it since that makes it public in your faves on a spring morning in 0 ada awoke to a special announcement she was pregnant it was not a new experience she had five children but it was unexpected news she would be 0 and her husband frank would be 0 when this baby was born some 0 years later while chatting with ada my grandma i asked what her first thoughts were when she discovered she was having my mom her response shocked me frank i will never forgive you for doing this to me she immediately followed up with but as i look over my life having betty janet and stuart in my later years has been my greatest blessing frances and marge are in their 0s and are not able to care for me between themselves having the younger children has allowed me to spend time with my children without being a burden to any one child we are here today to celebrate and honor the blessing of knowing of loving and of being loved by betty my mom mom was born into an active loving diverse three generation family her grandma 0 at the time crossed the plains as a mormon pioneer her father frank came to america via canada as a 0 year old looking for a better life than the one that was available to him in england her mother ada was a lively beautiful young woman who took on the challenges of raising her family and providing mutual support to her mother while frank was away with his work as a mining engineer moms older siblings married and moved away around the time mom entered stoker school the family soon grew to include grandchildren in particular mom had closeness to margie phyllis and renee who were more like sisters than nieces she loved her nephew stan who was always good for providing entertainment for the family the family was touched by the deaths of two grandsons grandma moms father frank and her oldest brother also named frank between 0 and 0 these experiences drew mom who was always close to her mother even closer they gave her the desire to enjoy the time she had with family and the hope of being reunited with loved ones after death in junior high mom became a talented seamstress one afternoon while my grandma was out mom took apart a blouse so she could study the pieces of cloth figure out how they were sewn together and re sewed the blouse to show grandma what she had learned she was a member of the yearbook staff at davis high school upon graduation she went to work at morrison merrill lumber company she took the civil service exam and was hired on at hill air force base as the first secretary in the engineering department when she left hill field a few years later she was one of only two secretaries at the base who held a gs 0 grade level around the time mom went to hill field a young man named richard entered her life he moved from brigham city to bountiful the previous summer to attend lds business college he lived with jim and wynona his uncle and aunt who were neighbors of moms family to quote from moms personal history two girls in our neighborhood asked me if i wanted to join with them to see who could get the first date with that good looking richard who had just come to town i replied that i wouldnt make a fool of myself for any boy that is the reason i had made myself scarce when he was around he thought i was stuck up but i really wasnt for dads perspective i will now quote from his personal history the moms family lived in the house south of us she was a widow with a boy and two girls still at home i knew stuart and janet quite well but thought betty jean was a very stuck up person since she seldom if ever joined in any of our conversations i did take notice that she came out and sat on their front porch in her shorts when i was working in our yard she claims it was unintentional but i claim it was too often to be just accidental and so while our mom was a flirt she was a selective flirt one day in august 0 as betty and dick passed each other on the sidewalk they spoke to each other out of nowhere he asked if she would like to go to a show to his surprise she accepted he had just asked for the first date in his life they went to a movie at the center theatre in salt lake and to quote from dads personal history again it was not nearly as bad as i thought it was going to be in fact it was quite enjoyable so in about a week i gave it another try continuing from dads history we seemed to enjoy being together but the bravest i got for our first five dates was to hold her hand occasionally in a show and then hold her hand while walking her to the door when we got home on our next date we were parked in from of her house i casually put my arm across the back of the seat and then moved it down on her shoulder before i knew what was happening she moved across the seat to my side and gave me a kiss that just about took my breath away it took me a couple of minutes to recover and i will admit that i returned the favor mom and dad married on april 0 0 in the salt lake temple over the years she taught him how to be a husband and later on how to be a father as a child i liked the fact that our names rhymed dee ann ilene dennis and dean when i learned there was an older sister annette who died as a baby i wanted to know more about her annettes death was the greatest sorrow and challenge in moms life at this point id like to talk about some of moms traits and interests and how they have been shared among family members mom was a sweet person much like her grandma and her own mother each loved being a mother and being a grandmother was an especially wonderful experience that love of being a mom and a grandma is shared by dee ann and ilene and dennis and i though less prolific than our sisters really enjoy being dads in spite of that sweetness mom had a less frequently manifested but humorous trait that could be defined as the let me yank your chain gene this was demonstrated when mom was a toddler learning to speak and her sister marge was taking a high school typing class each time marge made a mistake she would slam the typewriter carriage back and let out a few choice words mom stood by marges side saying mate mitates mowgie mate mitates dennis probably inherited the largest share of the let me yank your chain gene for example when i was 0 the family got ginger a beautiful seal point siamese cat dennis being the logical and mathematical seven year old that he was declared that since ginger was the family cat we each owned 0 0th of ginger furthermore the part of ginger we owned was based on age with mom a few months older than dad owning gingers head dennis carefully explained to me the parts that our parents sisters and he owned and then informed me that as the youngest member of the family i owned gingers tail and rear end that made me mad and i ran crying to mom she asked what had happened and i explained denniss allocation of ginger according to age mom comforted me for a few seconds and then said since she owned gingers head she would give me her share of ginger i went back to dennis and announced that i now owned 0 0ths of ginger her head in addition to her tail and rear end that love of pets is a shared trait among our family being raised during the great depression mom and dad were both fiscally conservative as funds became more available they did enjoy a few indulgences for example mom loved shoes im not sure about dee ann but i think ilene shares that trait with mom dennis on the other hand wears sandals when ever possible and on occasion has been caught in the snow with sandals my least favorite article of clothing to sell when i worked for mac was shoes and they are still my least favorite article of clothing to buy mom and dad could be a bit humorous with their definition of fiscal conservatism they did not buy a set of fine china until they had been married around 0 years they felt it would be spending too much to buy sterling silver at the same time a few years later they went to zcmi the item they were looking for was sold out so as they were leaving the store dad said they needed to buy something so he would not have to pay for parking mom walked over to the china and silver department and said how about a set of sterling silver it was one of their more expensive free parking validations on the few occasions when mom disagreed with dad she referred to him as your father about 0 years ago i received a letter from mom typed on her pc that had some unusual formatting problems midway through the letter she wrote excuse the appearance but your father wont support my word processing software any more and is making me learn a new program within 0 weeks mom mastered the new software and dad once again became dad in her letters around the same time at work we were installing our first software that would load new accounts directly onto our main processing system during a meeting with one of our offices a lady named mary who was in her 0s said she did not think she could learn our new software i told her about my mom learning new software in her 0s and said that within 0 weeks she had it down pat mary found encouragement in moms example and shared it with several other employees without realizing it mom became an inspiration to four or five ladies in central north carolina who needed to learn some new programs mom loved bountiful and her homes and life with dad and their family friends and neighbors she had no desire to travel widely but enjoyed some special trips with family the first was a trip california with francis amp clyde who took her to visit marge and glen the next was our familys tour of the eastern states before we returned home after our time in ohio mom and dad loved their trip to the northwest and into british columbia with aunt janet and uncle dwight the two couples were more than relatives they were great friends the other big trip was moms tour of europe with phyllis courtesy of dad and don next to annettes passing moms next greatest challenges were her longing for dad after his death in 0 and having to move from her home in 0 our visits and phone conversations could be both sweet and bittersweet last december while trying to decide what to give mom for christmas i concluded there was a limit to the number of trinkets or floral arrangements that could fit in her apartment and that she would probably be happiest spending christmas day together it was one of our shortest but most enjoyable visits i returned home to north carolina grateful to have spent what would probably be my last christmas and my last visit with mom when moms latest series of medical challenges began there were a series of phone calls and e mails about moms condition her prognosis her ups and her downs one trait we four children share with mom and dad is that all of us are pragmatic possibly too pragmatic with various issues back home in north carolina there were no suggestions or hints that i needed to come to utah for this latest medical round i had decided that i would come out for mothers day which fit better into my schedule the morning of april 0 after taking care of my dogs i went into the bathroom to prepare for the work day as i splashed hot water on my face to shave i looked in the mirror and thought mothers day might be too late i dried my face and hands walked into my study and booked a flight to utah it was a visit with some very nice highs especially the evening of mom and dads anniversary and a few of the hardest episodes that made me wonder why mom had to endure some of the things she was experiencing our last visit was poignant i did not want it to end and turned around three times and went back to mom before i finally left she handled it better than i did and smiled with contentment while i cried and tried to regain my composure the final cycle began last sunday with a call to let me know mom was being transferred to mckay dee hospital and that she was in a coma there were a series of phone calls with each of the siblings and spouses over the next few hours mom was in a coma and the tests showed that her vital organs were shutting down the final call from a tearful dennis told me that based on the medical results and moms lack of responsiveness the decision had been made to let her go the next hour or two were a slow motion whirlwind as i wrote a version of this talk searched out travel options and spoke with aaron who lives in seattle after hearing no further word i called denniss cell phone and asked for an update moms life began as a shock and a blessing and that is how it ended he said mom is sitting up and we are reminiscing about pets i said what he said were talking about ginger let me put you on the speaker phone so you can join the conversation what followed was a ten minute chat much like the conversations we had years ago before age and illness afflicted mom and dad when i asked how are you doing mom she replied well ive been better and ive been worse i called aaron to let him know mom was suddenly conscious coherent and talking and he called denniss cell phone and joined in the conversation mom said how nice it was to have dee ann and von ilene and dave and dennis ann and judd there with her and to have spoken with aaron and me on the phone around 0 0 a m monday morning i booked another flight to utah as i finished packing a few hours later dennis called and gave me the news mom was gone it took me a while to process and comprehend that final chat with mom and the family and i could not really put it into context until i arrived in utah and was filled in on the details the more i thought about it i felt a sense a peace that among last conversations we had as a family with mom was about one of the subjects most dear to each of us our cats and our dogs throughout her life mom always stated her wishes but then she would add thy will be done she did not want annette to die but accepted that she did not get to raise annette on earth she did not want to die in a hospital but in the end accepted that would be what happened i believe that once mom accepted thy will be done the lord gave mom and us a miracle in the form of a final enjoyable entertaining last visit ive struggled with how to end the talk around 0 0 a m this morning the thought came that i should conclude by sharing a few thoughts about my relationship with mom i am the bonus baby the one born after three miscarriages one death two near deaths and one healthy but small baby in 0 mom received her patriarchal blessing which stated sons and daughters would be born to her after seven pregnancies resulting in two daughters to raise and one son i feel it took a great deal of courage and faith to risk one more pregnancy in hopes of having a second son i think aaron ilene amp dave and dennis amp ann were a bit concerned about me yesterday when we went to see mom at the funeral home she looked beautiful but we each grieve in our own way and seeing her body did not bring me a lot of peace what brings me peace is reading her life story and the letters we exchanged over the years what brings me peace is looking at the photos and remembering our experiences over the years what brings me peace is listening to a voice mail she left after flowers and chocolates were delivered for valentines day and hearing her end with her signature sign off i love you i love you i love you the final thing that brings me peace is that mom after 0 years will finally spend mothers day with annette annette was born on may 0 0 she died on may 0 0 a saturday around midnight the next morning mothers day mom learned that her first baby had died to annette thank you for letting us have these years with mom please give her some extra hugs from each of us and to mom i love you i love you i love you i say this in the name of jesus christ amen

4644354873 contentment outing with danbo not one life goes by in which the quest for joy and happiness is absent it is unfortunate however that people so often believe that the search will be entirely fulfilled by finding the perfect job acquiring some new gadget losing weight or maintaining an image the problem inherent in looking outward for sources of happiness is that focusing on what you do not have or what you are not inevitably leads to unhappiness it is easy to get caught up in your desires and to ignore the sources of joy and growth already present in your life it is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence when you have stopped comparing yourself and your assets to others you will be able to recognize that to others you are on the quot greener side quot learning to live in te moment and enjoy your personal lot can be a source of profound contentment unhappiness inspired by what you do not have is easy to overcome when you open your eyes to the wonderful things already present in your life remember that joy is a state of mind and it is pointless to sacrifice the happiness of today for a set of possibilities that may or may not come to be p s finally danbo arrived it was a long day in campus until a parcel with a japan stamp greeted me upon returning home

4793891456 anger kashmir in crisis civilians hostage to security forces kashmir in crisis civilians hostage to security forces a dharna to register protest against killings of innocent civilians in kashmir at jantar mantar was organised by anhad the dharna was two hour long where representatives from various civil society groups gathered to demonstrate their solidarity with the people of kashmir following people expressed their views in protest shabnam hashmi anhad harsh kapoor south asia citizens web navaid hamid member nic prof kamal mitra chenoy jnu prof anuradha chenoy jnu tanveer hussain khan anhad indu prakash igsss madhu chandra north eastern helpline divya ywca sanjay kumar aaa amitabh pandey free lancer ravi himadri the other media prof rizwan kaisar jamia millia islamia swami agnivesh mansi sharma anhad seema duhan anhad the following statement was released to the media it is a matter of grave concern and anguish that no sensitive measures have been taken by the central government in response to the ongoing deaths injuries and killings in cold blood of civilians in srinagar and anantnag districts of jammu and kashmir including young girls and boys most of them innocent peaceful protestors or even just bystanders and consequently both north and south regions of the valley are on flame to make matters worse the army along with para military forces have been issued orders to shoot at sight to uphold the almost relentless curfew basically to block protests against the continuing spiral of non stop and indiscriminate killings of innocent civilians the presence of army and security forces dominates the valley and reinforces the deep rooted angst of people the reality is that democracy is under severe strain and is almost absent in many parts in this state despite an elected government backed by the centre holding the reigns of power at srinagar anhad and many other concerned civil society groups in india want the governments in the state and centre to come out clean urgently and immediately and explain if this is indeed a democratic and constitutional method of handling a manifold and multiplying crisis in a highly sensitive region obviously the establishment thinks that branding it as mere law and order problem and repression and killings would 'calm down ' the situation as sensitive and grim as that of jammu and kashmir this will be like choking tens of thousands of people into the silence of absolute suffering and blind rage will this violence ever stop and will we ever find the root causes for a political solution based on consensus understanding mutual harmony and human rights tuesday began with protests against one death which led to the second death and then suddenly srinagar was back under curfew the cycle of violence has spun out of control all over again last week witnessed a similar series of killings taking its toll in anantnag district where people were killed in clashes with security forces since they were not allowed to protest against the killings of civilians this has become a tragic and vicious circle of hopelessness instead of issuing any statement of sympathy or concern or wisdom our highest offices of governance in the country are only pushing for an escalation in the number of deployment of security forces this clearly indicates the callous attitude of the governments in delhi and srinagar such acts of brutality are in complete violation of the law of the land and constitutional rights of the people that have resulted in mass outrage and alienation of large sections of the civilian population in kashmir these are unarmed non violent citizens who are being treated with such blatant and indiscriminate use of military force why is there no other way to negotiate with civil unrest and what is the root cause of this civil unrest if not the brutalities executed by the police and para military forces and what about cases of atrocities committed on people who are not even protesting there is no excuse for such cruelty despite repeated assurances by the central and state governments of zero tolerance towards human rights violations the fact remains that little has been done to punish those responsible for such heinous and gross violations this organised insensitivity and vacillation to act firmly against such elements is bound to put a question mark on the credibility of the state and its track record in terms of human and democratic rights of the people as enshrined in the indian constitution mere rhetoric and institution of official enquiries is not enough to restore the shattered and shaken confidence of the people it is imperative that the central and state authorities take firm and visible action against those responsible for unleashing this brutish violence on innocent people any delay will only compound the alienation and anger of the people resulting in irrefutable damage to the peace process in the valley and elsewhere in the state anhad expresses serious concern over the absolute antipathy and lack of political initiative displayed by the upa led central government in response to the situation in the valley they should learn some lessons from history people can not be won over or suppressed at gun point certainly the people of jammu and kashmir deserve a more rational humane visionary and sensitive response from the indian state we demand from the central and the state governments to take immediate action to prevent further loss of life and property put an end to the violence perpetrated by the security forces with immediate effect immediately appoint an independent and impartial time bound commission of enquiry to look into the killings of peaceful civilians amp human rights violations initiate an inquiry into instances of attacks on ambulance services ensure security of the journalists both of local and national media ensure freedom of expression and press immediately start a political dialogue with

5060038719 contentment 0 colour weave wheel this sculpture is very significant to me in quite a number of different ways i suppose it represents the perpetual turning of the wheel but this time it has clicked into a new gear new materials new techniques new horizons something less ephemeral that has taken longer to create and yet still made only from materials gathered from hedgerows nearby all natural colours no dyeing or anything else required land art has opened me up and turned me inside out and revealed my soul it has shown me there may be a different way to exist provided clarity through the fog and given me a whole new purpose a purpose that now seems deep set within me and crucially it is now coupled with the drive and self confidence to make something happen this was always missing from my life before i am amazed and also saddened by the amount of people i talk to who feel they are trapped in the hamster wheel of working life each one of them dreaming of a statistically very unlikely lottery win or a key that will unlock the padlock that chains them to their desk and a life of boredom and drudgery i used to spend my life like many others do trying to portray to the world something i was not i bought gadgets and expensive things to create an aura around myself of success and wealth and yet i was neither successful nor wealthy monetarily or within my soul i know now that all i was trying to do was fill the hole inside of me but instead all i did was draw a curtain across it and i now see this going on all around me some people i know in particular are very much stuck running around this wheel a wheel that gradually screws itself into the ground as their ostentatiousness that is needed to cover their path has to grow and grow and grow new car check new big house check personalised number plates check the constant need to tell everyone how successful and happy you are check the never ending urge to be better than everyone around you check real contentment and happiness inside that check bounces if you feel the need to constantly tell people that you are very successful and happy then you are really missing the point if there is a hole in the bottom of your boat that is letting in water then spending your cash on a bigger and bigger ladle to bail out the water until it is solid gold and diamond encrusted means you have n't noticed that your boat is still sinking if you spend long enough telling all your friends that you are better happier and more successful than them then eventually you wo n't have any friends to tell any more one day you 'll need to realise that you need to fix the boat and stop bailing a brand new gps boat navigation system is n't going to do that even if your boating neighbours are still using a compass and a sextant the last few years due to unforeseen circumstances i 've had to live a more frugal life what at first seemed like something to endure turned into a blessing in disguise during this time i learned to make land art sculptures i tried to get the best out of my camera when before in order to improve the quality of results i would have spent excessive money on bigger and more expensive equipment whilst never getting to grips with what i already had and as i emerge from this period and once again i could spend money on pointless gadgets i find i am not tempted in fact i want to down size and have less want to want less and strive to have less land art is free free of constraints of the modern world and nature provides her materials for free walking wondering and exploring are free and freeing there is n't much else that i need i had a lucid dream last night it was my first spontaneous one a few years ago i trained myself to have them and after a lot of effort i had a few so it was very interesting to have another one without any volition when i realised i was dreaming in my dream the intensity of everything increased ten fold i tried to make the sun rise and it did and then i had another go at flying normally when i have tried this before i kind of float four foot above the ground superman style but can only manage a walking pace glide i will myself to go faster and climb into the sky but it does n't happen it 's like i am only powered by wound up elastic band and not a rolls royce engine the after affects of a lucid dream are a feeling of elation carried into the waking day to go with this the sky was blue and bright and the golden autumn sunshine made my soul soar up into the clouds that i could n't quite reach in my dream whether my feeling of optimism for the future is due to the weather and the intensity of the dream does n't matter to me as i sit here typing these words i feel the clock has turned one more notch into a new phase of my life a future with many more days feeling free amongst nature the sun shining and the sky blue and then perhaps one day i can release myself from that low level hover and at last fly up into the sky oh and hello to the art teacher i met out at birk bank this evening it was nice to chat and i hope one day i do as well as your electrician mate

5772511599 contentment my cat mysteriously lovable and cunningly charming domestic cats have captivated the hearts of humans worldwide cats are unlike any other animal domesticated by humans in that they came into our homes for food and no other reason they make affectionate and loving pets but still retain many of the features that allowed them to survive in the wild the domestic house cat is widely thought to have originated in egypt approximately 0 years ago recent findings however suggest that domestic cats originated in the middle east nearly 0 years ago researcher carlos a driscoll concluded that every house cat in the world originates from a subspecies of wildcat found in the middle east felis silvestris lybica this conclusion was based on dna samples taken from wildcats and domestic cats worldwide more than 0 percent of american households have cats and more than 0 million cats live with humans worldwide more than 0 kittens are born in the u s each year cats are an obviously important part of households in western cultures evidenced by an estimate that as of the mid 0s services and products exclusively for cats had become a billion dollar industry the cat fancier 's association the largest cat registry in the world recognizes 0 breeds of domestic cat the international cat association the second largest registry recognizes 0 breeds genetically all of these breeds are very similar with the only differences being in features such as coat color and fur length and texture there is a notable absence of the wide range of shapes sizes and dispositions found in the breeds of dogs this is due to all house cats having descended from a common ancestor the middle eastern wildcat domestic cats retain many of the features that aided their survival in the wild they have excellent vision and can see up to 0 feet away their peripheral vision is about 0 degrees and they need only one sixth the amount of light that humans need in order to see thus providing them with the ability to see well at night their hearing is sharp a cat can hear sounds as high pitched as 0 khz compared to a human 's 0 khz a cat can pivot its ears 0 degrees using 0 or more muscles to do so cats use 0 muscles to leap jump and sprint a cat can run as fast as 0 miles per hour a feature that makes cats favored pets is their ability to communicate their emotions and needs to humans cats have more than 0 vocal sounds they will rarely meow at another cat they reserve this sound exclusively for humans much of a cat 's communication is done with its tail a tail held high indicates happiness a twitching or thrashing tail should be taken as a warning and a tucked tail signals insecurity when a cat jerks its tail from side to side it indicates indecision a sound individual to cats is the purr which is created by contractions of the cat 's diaphragm while sometimes heard in anxious or ill cats the purr is often a sign of contentment

6166142667 contentment some thoughts on smoking i once read that cannabis is a 'gateway ' drug that its use leads to the use of more illicit drugs in fact there is no scientific consensus on the truth of that suggestion but my experience was rather the opposite that it led to the use of a less illicit as in socially taboo but in fact more dangerous drug namely tobacco shortly after i was born my dad gave up smoking but despite repeated attempts my mum was n't able to do the same my gran still has a letter which i wrote to her at the age of seven which reads quot dear nana mum says she will definitely give up smoking this time quot the sight of her father my grandpa a smoker for fifty years on his nebuliser to mitigate the symptoms of his emphysema finally steeled her will and she kicked the habit i was 0 and having lived with it all those years made me hate them i was certain that i would never even so much as try a cigarette and in spite of a fascination with and appreciation of the way it looked which as you can tell continues to this day i would n't at that time have dreamed of dating anyone who touched them weed however was another matter when i was in my late teens and a few friends and i would occasionally get together to smoke weed i would have to be reminded each time the joint came to me how to smoke years later during a night out when i was twenty one someone handed me a cigarette and without even thinking i took a draw i realised then that so much of the pleasure i had taken from smoking cannabis was not because of the cannabis but because of the smoking it became a regular thing my attitude to my smoking was conceited i was self congratulatory about it i felt that i had started to smoke for the right reasons not because my friends pressured me which they did n't we were too old then for that and not to look good or cool lord knows i do n't unlike so many of my friends suit a cigarette and i did n't smoke because i needed to i was not addicted i smoked one a day and i did it because i enjoyed it those beautiful few minutes after dinner when all alone i would light up reflect and separate the stresses of the day from the evening that was to follow the frasier character bebe glazer has summed up the joy of smoking in this hilarious clip www youtube com watch v b0qazc0bnk and while i genuinely believe that smoking can be a wonderful thing beryl bainbridge called tobacco quot the handmaiden of creativity quot to which i can relate addiction disease and smelling bad are not wonderful things i 've been a smoker for four years now and the number of cigarettes i smoke each day has increased at the rate of one a year these days i probably average around five a day and for the past year or so i 've been trying to cut back i always thought that five a day was too many and by the time i reached that point i would have one before my breakfast on some mornings i 've always said and continue to say that i will never quit there may for all i know come a time when i wo n't have smoked a cigarette for a year but even on that day i will still consider myself a smoker i do n't want to stop smoking but i would love to go back to that first year when i smoked one after dinner each night and that was all or perhaps to take it further i would love to smoke like fraser here once every couple of weeks on a night or a day out he will ask me for a cigarette continue to smoke them for that day or night and then that will be the last i will see of him smoking for another couple of weeks perhaps even a month i remember hearing a character in a film say that she smokes quot only in times of extreme stress or contentment quot and i liked that idea i do n't mean to promote or glamourise smoking i know its risks and the harm it can cause but i also know the joy and pleasure of smoking it is a truly deep pleasure like holding someone 's hand and looking into their eyes not a superficial pleasure like eating a sweetie as with so much in life it is about finding the balance and that balance will be different in each person between what we want what we need and what are able to handle glasgow 0 about me twitter facebook

6493737303 contentment chicago il north beach june '0 nikon coolpix s0 iso0 gt gimp i took several shots up here this is probably the worst one but i could edit it quickly while uploading the previous shot or so i thought anyway this do n't look all that bad sort of like taking manhattan west of the east river and just moving it to jamacia beach which i suppose makes sense after chicago was entirely rebuilt after the fire in 0 i guess or was it 0 so much for cities that are thousands of years old is rome better now than it was before nero fiddled lol i guess for christians certainly well after giving up on using my bb0 as a modem with my tmobile account i settled for one of their quot rocket 0 0 quot 0g usb modem adapters for my laptop i know quot ancient tech quot by todays ' standards and not even usb0 0 and i 'm using it now quot oh no quot and it seems to work pretty well really even on a 0g connection with one bar runs rings around my old sprint adapter which i had this time last year and just sucked really i 'd say that it 's almost as fast if not quot snapper quot than my comcast cable modem connection though it 's rated at 0kb sec quot bits not bytes arrgh quot and my comcast connection was up to 0mbits sec and that was 0 years ago probably more in the meantime it just made no sense to pay 0 for a home cable connection that only worked at home no matter how fast it was especially if comcast would n't let you use it for a quot server quot i e no real uploads and no real sustained download though they seem to have realized that video is usually quot sustained quot serious hair splitting for quot unlimited internet quot i have no idea what the rate is for this thing i just know it 's supposedly unlimited decently fast and works well away from home though i had to fire it up a couple of times before it really got in gear and i 've yet to get it to work have n't tried with my linux laptop while my sprint adapter worked just fine with it so if the cost is acceptable my phone alone is 0 month that 's one problem down the next is having to lug this old 0 quot laptop around with me or spending 0 on some form of ipad and i really really need to get one it 's become almost a must have item but what do you expect when the average quot portable computing device quot is now limited to 0gb of ram a 0ghz processor and a 0 quot display with embedded graphics now simply because that is all that just about every internet related app really needs especially behind a 0g line and just about every app that anyone really needs now is tied to the internet who cares if i want to do quot real work quot far far away from my desk or home office well i do i want to ride out somewhere an hour out of town find a park or a library sit down somewhere peaceful with the sun shining and nice weather and just sit there and work who wants to stare at the same damm 0 walls every day in the same part of town that 's not quot creativity quot that 's bureaucracy that 's what people do whose role is to be in a certain place over a certain time well i would like to be in quot a certain place over a certain time quot mentally not just physically and that place is not quot in an office downtown quot and that time is not 0 0 every day or actually 0 0 as the case may be or not be but usually is for me quot work quot usually means that i 'm there early and getting off late and why would i want to do that in the same place each and every day i spend 0 of my life either at work or commuting that 's time that can never be replaced if i must work i would prefer to work with at least some pleasant variety in terms of scenery surroundings is that not why we got into photography so we do n't have to look at the same dreary things every day i think so so increased quot mobility quot makes us better photographers simply because we are n't in the same place all the time and a certain minimum level of connectivity is required so that we can remain productive quot gainfully employed quot while we 're on the road unless we want to be factory workers in china or sling burgers at mcdonalds those of us who need high performance computing have been separated into two groups those who need a high performance personal computer and those who need high performance video there are many ways to get the latter it is no longer required to have a powerful gpu with fast memory running on an sli rig an easy way to get it is simply to write better software and design video apps that have a high quot image content quot datarate ratio just like with photography quot more pixels bigger sensors bigger lenses quot does not always equal quot better images quot sometimes it 's worse for endemic reasons if anything the key to better images is simply to get out and see more often the key to a better life is simply to get out and see more though of course like better gear this can be overdone but can one be content with quot good enough quot i do not ask about quot true contentedness quot how about just quot happy quot can we really be happy in such a condition or are we just fooling ourselves reduced to an intellectual argument that is forced to reach that conclusion by our quot maturity quot and quot rational nature quot what if we are forced to be unhappy with life simply because intellectually we rationalize quot happiness quot where it does n't exist we quot rationally quot confine ourselves to this state of existence or perhaps we 're simply forced to try to be happy and rational in a rationally unhappy state of existence simply by the facts of our existence and available options out of our current state of existence and quite possibly our subconscious our quot emotional side quot rebels in many ways well certainly with enough experience we will know when we are truly happy and not just at the end of a rational road which quot logically quot equates to quot contentment quot well now i have an idea how fast this rocket 0 0 is i 'm viewing a tv show online and downloading it using downitall and the average is 0kb sec sustained with peaks in the 0kb sec range on a 0g connection at 0 0pm on a saturday night oh look and it 's even plug amp play in ubuntu how nice though there 's no connection management utility just the ubuntu networking interface and the light is blue on my rocket vs green which i guess means a 0g connection anyway it 's fast quite fast more than quot comfortably fast quot anyway all i know is that there is a fine line between finding happiness through logical quot reasonable quot activity and finding it through irrational unreasonable activity that fundamentally deep down inside makes us really truly happy think of quot schadenfreude quot at the very least and what happens when we make ourselves happy by convincing ourselves that unreason is reason that irrationality is rationality that illogic is logic of course that is an irrational thing to do right but obviously it could work anyway given the right circumstances so we have proven logically that success is not necessarily the product of rational thought attitudes quot behaviors quot often it is the product of irrational ones carried out in atmospheres that are conducive to their success despite their irrationality i wonder what we could prove if we simply abandon concern with logic and reason altogether and we had the power to force others to at least try to make us happy with our conclusions need i preface the nouns quot logic quot and quot reason quot with quot true quot really what fucking difference would that make quot truth quot is in the eye of the beholder reality is in the mind of the observer quot logic quot and quot reason quot are whatever anyone wants to think that they are you have your opinion i have mine what physical law is there that says that i must agree with you there are none other than the quot laws quot that exist in your own head my version of quot logic quot says that nothing can be true as an opinion unless someone actually holds it and as such it is obvious that there are multiple opinions on the same topic just as there are multiple people truly their opinions can be expected to vary over time to think that there is only one opinion on any topic is ludicrous at least in my mind of course there is no law that says that you must agree with me so in our quot democratic quot society we end up with quot logic quot that is logical because most people believe it to be quot logical quot but what sense does it make to define reality based on popular opinion when we say that the world makes quot progress quot in what way do we mean this well quite often it is quot progress quot away from current popular opinion as more and more people find things to be undeniably true because they are shown to be undeniably true to them on a regular basis eventually even the biggest luddite out there believes that they are true but what do we do in the meantime

to report to gen rufus saxton a strong protector of freedman who commanded the occupation forces in south carolina 0 fire images mrd vid0 0 mrd vid0 0 mrd vid0 0 mrd vid0 0 md i entered the city which from earliest childhood and through life i had learned to contemplate with feelings of utmost abhorrence where the sound of the lash at the whipping post and the hammer of the auctioneer mrd vid0 0 were coordinate sounds in thrilling harmony such as might well have vied for the infamous king of dahomey mrd vid0 0 for a moment i found myself dashing in unmeasured strides through the city again i halted to look upon the shattered walls mrd vid0 0 of the once stately but now deserted edifices and but for the vigilance and fidelity mrd vid0 0 of the colored firemen there would have been nothing left but a smoldering plain of runs in the place where charleston once stood mrd vid0 0 narrator chief justice salmon chase in charleston said a great race numbering four million is suddenly brought in freedom all the world is looking to see whether the prophecies of the enemies of that race will be fulfilled or falsified it rests upon the men of that race to tell mrd vid0 0 delany made it in time mrd vid0 0 to see the flags changed at fort sumter with his son a young private also there and his old friend mrd vid0 0 and comrade in arms william lloyd garrison who as he bade goodbye to a large adoring audience in charleston said garrison i have always advocated non resistance but this much i say to you come what may never will you submit again to slavery do anything die first mrd vid0 0 but dont submit again to them never again be slaves farewell mrd vid0 0 narrator major delany the first black field officer in the u s army mrd vid0 0 quickly organized schools farms mrd vid0 0 farmers freedmen and tried to reason with disenfranchised plantation owners mrd vid0 0 who were always trying to tie new freedman into enslaving contracts exploiting their illiteracy mrd vid0 0 but delany they loved he was one of them and he told it to them straight mrd vid0 0 md i came to talk to you in plain words so as you can understand how to open the gates of oppression and let the captive free mrd vid0 0 in this state there are 0 thousand able intelligent honorable negroes not an inferior race mind you mrd vid0 0 i want to tell you one thing do you know that if it was not for the black man mrd vid0 0 this war never would have been brought to a close with success mrd vid0 0 do you know that mrd vid0 0 do you know that mrd vid0 0 narrator but they would be asked to submit again and soon from the moment a bullet penetrated the great liberators brain at fords theater no such a grand promise of land and freedom would ever hold in may just a month later mrd vid0 0 the newly appointed president johnson ordered all these lands those not properly surveyed returned mrd vid0 0 to some 0 plantation owners even if mrd vid0 0 someone elses crop was already growing in the field one freedman wrote to andrew johnson himself mrd vid0 0 we have been ready to strike for liberty and humanity yea to fight if need be to preserve the glorious union and now we are ready to pay for this land mrd vid0 0 sign contracts with your old master and work their land as partners this was the plea to most freed blacks mrd vid0 0 throughout that long summer delanys superiors generals howard and saxton avoided johnsons order and eventually defied them outright until september mrd vid0 0 when they broke the news to the freedmen they loved so much an edisto island freedman wrote his friend mrd vid0 0 gen howard you ask us to forgive the landowners of our island you only lost your right to arm in war and might forgive them mrd vid0 0 the man who tied me to a tree and gave me thirty nine lashes who stripped and flogged my mother and sister and who will not let me stay in his empty hut unless i do his planting that man i can not forgive general we can not remain here mrd vid0 0 narrator many left south carolina some stayed and were beaten mrd vid0 0 delany fought md every species of infamy however atrocious private and public bare faced and in open daylight mrd vid0 0 is defiantly perpetrated under the direction and guidance of the despicable political leaders in the sacred name of republicanism and radicalism mrd vid0 0 but these yankees talk smooth to you oh yeh their tongues roll just like the drum they dont pay you enough mrd vid0 0 i was told to stay out of politics narrator the forty acres and a mule promised to freedmen were already secretly being returned to the planters courtesy of the tireless machinations of trescott and williams in washington mrd vid0 0 they even got gen sherman to write president johnson on the brink of being court martialed for his opposition mrd vid0 0 gen howard wrote his superiors the lands which have been taken possession by this bureau have been solemnly pledged to the freedman thousands of them are already located on tracts of forty acres each mrd vid0 0 the love of the soil and desire to own farms amounts to a passion mrd vid0 0 it appears to be the dearest hope of their lives mrd vid0 0 narrator within two years the freedman bureau had its main function of redistributing the lands to original owners and apologizing for it mrd vid0 0 saxton was reassigned gen howard court martialed mrd vid0 0 but col delany a survivor pressed on he had made himself too valuable to too many people in a very short time mrd vid0 0 republican politicians like christopher columbus bowen who controlled the patronage at the customs house hated his dangerously incorruptible independence mrd vid0 0 and integrity but like everyone mrd vid0 0 bowed to his almost messianic hold on the freedmen mrd vid0 0 this the long awaited black leader mrd vid0 0 and on the other side the old southern aristocracy mrd vid0 0 saw delanys magic too and planned to use him someday mrd vid0 0 for their own ends as one old southern editor put in grudging admiration martin delany is a genuine negro mrd vid0 0 md no one who knows me will doubt my african proclivities i have possessions in africa which i hope to enjoy narrator the old southern guard watched and waited they noticed delanys perceptibly growing disgust with corruption greased palms and greed mrd vid0 0 that fueled his own republican partys machine md the freedmans bureau was allowed to continue to return those 0 acres to the planters mrd vid0 0 i told freedman to get educated to see what was going on through two crop failures in 0 and 0 i told freedmen to rely on their muscles mrd vid0 0 their faith and the righteousness of their cause 0 saw almost all of those 0 promised acres mrd vid0 0 were back in planters hands and some 0 of south carolinas freedmen mrd vid0 0 had left in disgust and desperation mrd vid0 0 0 brothers and sisters set sail for my beloved africa the best of our people their hopes were gone before mine delanys disgust deepened on a trip to new york city where he represented the state in a bond issue and he found out that governor chamberlain mrd vid0 0 had given his old college chum and roommate 0 in commissions mrd vid0 0 the old southern guard watched and waited knowing that martin delany might be the key to regaining power mrd vid0 0 wade hampton we can control the negroes if we act discreetly i would come to know people like wade hampton an embodiment of the old south who invited me to speak at barbecue gatherings hampton if it means we can protect our state from destruction i am willing to send negroes to congress they will be better than anyone who can take the oath of loyalty and i should rather trust them than renegades or yankees my experience has been that when a yankee can do a bit of rascality the temptation to do it is almost irresistible mrd vid0 0 narrator no one though would be a more fateful associate in martin delanys long and broad lifetime as wade hampton the old cavalry general aristocrat and front man for the south who yes truly speaking personally for himself wished for a better life for the freedman because he and delany both fervently lived and advocated personal honor and a regimen of book learning and practical skills as every freedmans road to true permanent economic redemption mrd vid0 0 it was only a matter of time that these two stars would head on a one on one collision and one of those two stars would orbit around the other mrd vid0 0 if only there had been more than just one wade hampton and one martin delany americas working educated electorate would have emerged sooner but the personal prestige humanitarian and pragmatic ways of each man could only briefly capture the public imagination mrd vid0 0 while at all other times whites blacks democrats and republicans slid disgracefully into the abyss where guns and bribes were constantly used as the preferred path to personal power and glory mrd vid0 0 pressured out of the freedmans bureau in 0 delany was retired from public life selling real estate and editing his own newspaper when rev richard cain came to him one day in 0 and urged him to help elect franklin moses mrd vid0 0 he might even get for his efforts a decent job later to support his seamstress wife catherine and their large family mrd vid0 0 delany could deliver freedmens votes hoping to enhance his own political fortunes in this state with a majority of black voters and hoping to get more homesteads for freedmen delany stumped vigorously for moses mrd vid0 0 moses had always given lip service to delanys plan to attract northern money to be long term low interest loans to help the freedmen to buy and develop their own homesteads mrd vid0 0 delanys unvarnished truth telling inspired the common people and irked those grubbing after filthy lucre mrd vid0 0 wrote onetime governor b f perry after mature reflection i believe col delany has exhibited in his speeches more wisdom and prudence more honor and patriotism than any other republican white or black in south carolina mrd vid0 0 delany wrote that should the homeless become landowners they would at once become proportionately interested in the affairs of state before either school house or church can be erected he said the people themselves must be settled in homes of their own mrd vid0 0 freedmen were leaving the state denied the once promised forty acres virtually all back in original hands and their life savings deposited faithfully in the freedmans savings and trust company now gone form mismanagement mrd vid0 0 delany knew his plan could work in three years he organized white cotton wholesalers and freedmen farmers on hilton head island into a peaceable alliance that grew and harvested the crop profitably moses was elected mrd vid0 0 so was honest john who boasted he bought his seat in the u s senate for 0 mrd vid0 0 but governor moses continued to drive even higher the state debt mrd vid0 0 it had already soared from one to over seventeen million dollars in the previous five years moses then raised taxes on freed holders to pay for all this mrd vid0 0 and he lined his pockets with priced pardons sold to 0 imprisoned felons and they were all released into this heavily armed hate filled powder keg land and governor moses gave delany no job mrd vid0 0 rev cain wrote moses i had assured mr delany that you would not break faith he has staked all on your word for heavens sake do not cast him away mrd vid0 0 seeing beauforts old st helena church summed up a visitors feeling in 0 about every south carolina town he saw mrd vid0 0 it was one of complete prostration dejection mrd vid0 0 stagnation mrd vid0 0 visitor utter stagnation marks its streets and everything is flavored with decay the mockingbird sings as if winter has no meaning for them mrd vid0 0 the old mansions are permeated with the air of desertion the merry tinkling that proceeds from the closed shutters of one of them seems altogether dissonant with the surroundings mrd vid0 0 bad crops bad weather a lost position in world cotton markets a national depression this all contributed mrd vid0 0 so by 0 all of south carolina including delanys beloved st helena island looked like an armed camp mrd vid0 0 the ku klux klan was forming almost three hundred rifle clubs that once beat two hundred freedmen and killed four more in nine months in just one county mrd vid0 0 freedmen either armed themselves mrd vid0 0 or prayed the federal troops would never leave mrd vid0 0 some freedmen and their families slept in the swamps in the mild winter where the men in hoods and facemasks could not find them mrd vid0 0 wrote the editor of the edgefield advertiser in one of the states most strife torn counties good people now look upon the entire electoral contest as a struggle between thieves and plunderers mrd vid0 0 and they worried among the whites is a class of men who hold human life of little value mrd vid0 0 and among the colored people there is a class who do not wish to labor and are known as habitual thieves or disturbers of the peace mrd vid0 0 gen rufus saxton wrote back his old friend robert smalls about these darkest of times in south carolina i rejoiced when the right of suffrage came and i sorrowed when it was told that some had sold this precious birthright for a miserable mess of potage mrd vid0 0 a few years earlier delany heard the church bells ring when the fourteenth amendment had been passed but it was a hollow sound mrd vid0 0 he saw freedmen unable to read show up at the freedmens bureau with great baskets the word registration sounded not much different from that other word provisions mrd vid0 0 the republicans vampire like bite into the states ebbing lifeblood blinded them to that emerging menace and giant the old southern democrats mrd vid0 0 and their gun toting right wing rabble delany saw this disaster collision coming md again and again i warned the majority republicans to go easy on the white planters mrd vid0 0 because one day the shoe would go over to their foot and sure enough it did mrd vid0 0 narrator delany ran for lieutenant governor in 0 on an independent reformed republican ticket getting 0 votes as corrupt chamberlain won md i lost my race but the planters got the shoe on their foot capturing the majority of seats in the statehouse mrd vid0 0 narrator delany was made justice of the peace in charleston when as the gubernatorial election drew near in 0 was indicted courtesy of governor chamberlain for misusing the funds of a dirt poor black church mrd vid0 0 hardly the implicit threat was do not support wade hampton who was now the official candidate against chamberlain with all the wealth and smart men the old south could muster squarely behind him mrd vid0 0 hampton and delany always appealed to peoples desire for peaceful solutions based on reason and fair play hampton i pledge myself solemnly in the presence of the people of south carolina mrd vid0 0 and in the presence of my god that if the democratic ticket is elected not one single right enjoyed by the colored people today shall be taken from them mrd vid0 0 narrator as violence increased the extreme democratic clubs secretly assigned one man to personally bribe or scare one freedman from voting mrd vid0 0 as chamberlains campaign promises became more grotesque and desperate delany announced for wade hampton in september 0 mrd vid0 0 immediately putting his life at risk delany fought hard and spoke forcefully for hampton md freedmen i told one and all were serving a new master now the radical republican carpetbaggers i said the blackest truth out loud a black man would not be allowed to lead not just to live but to lead i myself always dared to do what the white men ever dared and done to pull on every lions tail a white man has pulled mrd vid0 0 narrator on october 0th c c bowen promised me that our party of white and black democrats could speak to freedmen on edisto island mrd vid0 0 before the steamer left the charleston wharf a number of republican negroes gathered and they noisily demanded that they be permitted to take passage and threateningly declared that they wanted a chance to clean out those democrats mrd vid0 0 md the audience at the meeting of some 0 or 0 african citizens was by far the most uncouth savage and uncivilized that i have ever seen the republican negroes started to beat their drums and left in a body they would listen to de damn democrats mrd vid0 0 they marched off and the women crowded around the wagon with their bludgeons with threats and curses mrd vid0 0 md i rose to speak on the wagon they interrupted me as i said i had come to south carolina with my sword drawn to fight for the freedom of the black man mrd vid0 0 i said i had warned you against trusting your money to the freedmans bank and that you had to your sorrow paid no heed to my warning mrd vid0 0 in violation of the agreement that neither party should carry guns or rifles to the place of meeting mrd vid0 0 the negroes had brought their muskets and secreted them in a nearby swamp and in an old house near a church not far from the speaking ground mrd vid0 0 they marched out of the swamp with their arms and opened fire upon the whites who were unarmed in the meantime i mr william e simmons and several aides to white men had taken refuge in a brick house adjoining the church the negro militia charged out of the swamp surrounded the brick house and tried to batter down the door mrd vid0 0 failing in this they broke open the windows and pointed muskets at us we all escaped except for mr simmons who upon emerging from the door was knocked down and beaten to death mrd vid0 0 six white men were killed and sixteen whites wounded that day one black man was killed the siege of cainhoy continued for several days afterwards mrd vid0 0 white racists conducted similar assaults against blacks especially in edgefield county narrator wade hampton did win by a fiercely contested 0 vote margin provided in part by an estimated 0 republican blacks who followed delanys example mrd vid0 0 md i had hurt the cause of my people beyond all imaginings mrd vid0 0 narrator then wade hampton made history with his election for governor still is dispute and the state in anarchy mrd vid0 0 he met at the willard hotel with president elect rutherford b hayes mrd vid0 0 who held onto his election by one electoral vote to keep his single electoral vote lead hayes and hampton agreed that hayes would support and confirm hamptons election and as hampton wrote hayes mrd vid0 0 hampton if the federal troops are withdrawn from the state house there shall be on my part or that of my friends no resort to violence mrd vid0 0 but we shall look for their maintenance solely to such peaceful remedies as the constitution and laws of the state provide mrd vid0 0 md u s soldiers were removed from the south on hamptons pact with hayes and i helped that one person called it the abandonment of the colored race mrd vid0 0 wade hampton appointed me judge and i remained until he was elected to the u s senate in 0 mrd vid0 0 but the secret all white charleston county democratic committee methodically organized the state county by county and parish by parish mrd vid0 0

during my long absences needed me mrd vid0 0 i was old my children needed their college educations at wilberforce the books that set my dreams afire long ago belonged to them now mrd vid0 0 so i was

6822010727 awe the fairy fountain as we grow older we are told to stop believing in fairies to forget such childlike nonsense to discard all things unexplainable and to live with in the real world but what if in truth the people who tell us such things are then ones that can not truly see what if all along what you knew in your deepest of hearts is that it is true fairies are subtle but within our everyday life guiding our creativity encouraging wonderment teaching us lessons and sometimes causing mostly harmless mischief on slow days there will always be sceptics and to them i say if you had looked upon this scene it would have just been a small tabletop misty fountain and a few plants and that would be it but to me i know it is far more so i waited and there within a miniature paradise i felt innocence and awe i believe and i always shall p s if you wait long enough they ask you to dance with them 0

6884828339 excitement 0 vientisiete the perfect hike '' quot it 's not the mountain we conquer but ourselves quot sir edmund hillary mountains there is nothing like them particularly the alpujarra and sierra almijara mountain chains in southern spain where i have had the good fortune of spending two months last year farming climbing camping and most memorably hiking being an oklahoma girl to the core i dont really know too much about hiking mountains i did instinctively understand however that mountain hiking makes fantastic allegories for struggles in life great orators use mountains as metaphors mountains are climbed a step at a time and great gossipers use them as well i think shes just making a mountain out of a molehill if you ask me but during my time in spain i discovered firsthand another lesson mountains can teach you about life if you are making progress in doing something difficult usually it completely sucks in my hiking experiences before spain few and far between as they were i always started said jaunt out very optimistically usually it was on trails around beavers bend a breathtaking state park near my childhood home rarely were our hiking adventures well plannedoften we were already in the park swimming or boating around and just spur of the moment kicked off on a trail joyously trotting up the first 0 yards of the path or so my thoughts were higher than the clouds what a fantastic day for a little exercise out in nature with my closest friendswhat a beautiful view of that creek tree lake the top will be even more fantastic the weather today is just perfect shortly after those first 0 yards my thoughts would begin to sink lower to the ground i was trying to gain if i can just keep it up a bit longer maybe we will stop and take a water breakmaybe around the next corner we will have some downhill stretchessurely the top is not too much further by the time the hike was half over every bit of my optimism and joy would be squelched by efforts to keep up with my hiking companions why is this trail so winding why doesnt it just go straight up and get it over with ugh this view is ok how can it possibly be this much better from the top how come everyone else is so happy this sucks i would look up at my friends or family above me with a giant fake smile to reflect their genuinely happy faces thinking to myself all the while i just dont get this whats wrong with me of course eventually we would all reach the top me taking up the rear carrying with me a boatload of fake cheer on my face and grumbly thoughts in my mind and of course the view was much better than halfway up basking in the beautiful vista the relief of surviving the uphill march with most of my dignity and the collective satisfaction of our group all of my mumbles and grumbles evaporated in the sunlight of the mountaintop or hilltop in oklahoma perch the subsequent trip down was always a comparative breeze and as i floated down the trail i would ponder back to the uphill portion of the hike sometimes only 0 minutes to an hour previous and wonder why the heck was that so terrible i consider myself to be a reasonably fit person though im no true athlete im certainly not overweight or out of shape so why was that little jaunt such a mission everyone else always seemed to really enjoy it usually i concluded that my struggle must have been a circumstantial condition of that particular day maybe i didnt get enough sleep the night before perhaps i was dehydrated or didnt have a very substantial lunch i eventually settled upon one of these reasons and as we departed the trail i left with it the consideration of its struggle by the time the next hike was suggested i would have completely forgotten the wailing and gnashing of teeth from the last uphill battle so i would enthusiastically agree and this cycle continued for my childhood and into my adult life this august when i decided to spend a couple of months in southern spain wwoofing couchsurfing and generally hoboing around with billy silva this cycle was brought to a sudden and dramatic end before even starting the epic camping trip of 0 i realized from my experience the last couple of months one thing for sure i would enjoy the camping slacklining goofing around in the mountain streams picture taking deep conversat ing thats a word right downhill walking and even some flat trail walking parts of this trip but the one thing i was worried about was if i would enjoy the uphill portions of our tour anxiously i prepared making sure to get plenty of sleep the night before increasing my water intake eating full and balance meals and of course plenty of chocolate a wise lady once told me some people need to be sweetened daily i figure they especially need to be sweetened if they are about to go on an indefinite uphill hikeparticularly if they are hiking with a boyfriend who appears to love uphill battles and never ever tires i did everything to the best of my ability just like my papa taught me and as we started off on the trail i hoped for the best well the first 0 yards were pretty freakin great after that you know how the story goes as the familiar feelings of strain and pain began to set in i dejectedly evaluated what i could have done wrong why wasnt i hauling my butt up these inclines with more gusto why wasnt it fun gosh dangit and then i had an epiphany maybe hiking up mountains isnt fun surely no one can possibly actually think its fun to heave oneself up a vertical incline as quickly as possible while carrying everything you need to keep you alive for a couple of days on your back no one not sane people anyway billy truly seems to love it as evidenced by our hikesi was usually dragging behind considering throwing myself off of the nearest cliff while looking up ahead at his happy bouncy steps i swear he practically hopped up mountains like a crazed rabbit some people will always be hares clearly i am more like a tortoise maybe a lizard maybe hikers arent people that like the painful parts of hiking but instead they are people that like the positives of hiking the beautiful vistas the quiet serenity of a mountaintop the feeling of being so close to a giant blue sky you feel you can stick out your tongue and taste the light bouncing around up there they like the positives so much they are willing to pay for them with effort and sweat there wasnt anything wrong with me everyone hates dislikes hauling themselves and heavy stuff up vertical inclines what an exciting revelation i had on this hiking trip hiking basically just sucks its awesome to sit on a ledge off the side of a mountain and the first glimpse of the highest possible vista priceless but actually getting there not really fun everyone gets tired the person who makes it to the top is the one who figures out how to put it behind them to climb over it and leave it there until they get to the top and it melts away everyone is tired thats not the point the point is to keep on climbing maybe if i were more of an athlete by lifestyle i would have known this about mountains all along though from a more abstract perspective i actually did know it life has taught me in life there are lots of beautiful ledges from which to view breathtaking vistas like graduating on the front steps of the oklahoma state capitol building playing scrabble in spanish with new honduran friends on black sand beach weekend visits to new york city to spend hours wandering around the lower east side and having brunch with old best friends watching my mother chase my little sister around the kitchen with a broom in excitement after a surprise homecoming for thanksgiving watching lizards teaching an deployed american soldier to two step to kenyan disco music in the break of the indian ocean and of course mid may bikerides from stonewall to a friends front porch at 0 am lucky for me my life has been packed with those moments but life is more than ledges it has its fair share of actual climbing spending all day and half of the night in edmond lowe library classes with professors that suck at teaching and dont care holding a friends hand as she tells you her nightmares knowing you dont know what to say but must hold her hand as tight as you can anyway doctors visits sorting numerical data for research projects washing dishes weeding life just aint easybut anything worth having is worth working hard for any mountain worth climbing is worth the hike and this thought finds me here in my last semester at oklahoma state university close to reaching a summit of graduation from undergraduate life in may struggling with my usual mountain climbing questions to which deeply i know the answer why am i doing this why is the trail so winding could the view possibly be better from here its uncomfortable to keep hiking but thats the only thing to do keep cranking out papers keep studying for tests and for heavens sake keep going to class ill definitely have a couple of 0am bike rides thrown in there for now those can be my cairns of life but i cant forget i am on my way to the summit i have to keep moving vertically the view from the top is worth it see you on the other side of the next one

6960988839 contentment honouring your subject why you choose this image as one that honours your subject i chose this image as it encompasses the barren state of our family farm during the drought yet the beauty of natural disasters describe the circumstances of the photograph and what you tried to achieve with the image this photo was taken shortly after the fires of black saturday during the 0 drought i took this photo in a series to highlight the changes in colour and tone that occurs after extended periods of heat and dry weather the added smoke dramatises the image and is an indicator of how difficult these times were what you thought of amy toensings photo of doug amp harry i thought the image was quite beautiful due to the lighting and the way in which the image is symmetrically balanced however it wasnt until amy toensing began describing the two men and their living circumstances that i could truly appreciate the image and what it represented your opinion as to why the photo editor did not like amys photo the photo editor would not have been able to fully understand the meaning of the photograph as without the story behind the two men it is difficult to grasp the beauty of doug and harrys living arrangements and therefore the image itself what did the photograph convey about the lives of the two brothers particularly in reference to amys story that she related to us viewing the image alone the two men can appear quite strange and perhaps lonely not experiencing the usual marriage children and so on however teamed with amy toensings stories of doug and harry generates a form of contentment the men share with their living circumstances due to the company of each other how did the formal elements of the picture contribute to the emotional elements within the picture the formal elements such as the soft lighting and warm colours seem to contribute to the innocent nature of the two men and perhaps highlight a sense of calm and contentment they share within their living arrangements

confluence coordinates 0'0 n 0'0 e this is my faourite shot of the confluence of indus and zanskar rivers is 0km southeast of nimmu village at ladakh india the indus runs through entire ladakh all along by your side serving as a constant companion and you feel a sense of respect for this stream of water that is the lifeline of the people of ladakh especially since ladakh experiences a rainfall of only 0 to 0 inches throughout the year a land of endless beauty in the form of dry land with monasteris dotting its landscape and lakes so pure that you can only stand agape in awe is made more exotic by the indus on the banks of which one can spend endless evenings just looking into the vastness of ladakh and reasonably concluding that it is this virgin nature of the land mostly untouched since decades that has kept the people in this gifted land insulated from the world that we claim to be modern soon my first book on 0 miraculous wonders of world you must see when u alive will be out with quot 0 wow quot i phone application by the end of this year updating my official website sundeepkullu com with indus constantly flowing by our side you do not realise that you had reached nimu it was only when the driver pointed out that the grandiosity of the sight that unfolded right before our eyes came to the fore right in front of us were the indus and zanskar rivers getting lost into each other as if they had flown all along just for that from this point on beyond this confluence of the two the stream of water is regarded as the indus river and the zanskar does not exist beyond this point what amazes you most about this confluence is the difference in colours of the two rivers the zanskar no more remains its muddy self beyond this point and loses its parent nature in the process of becoming a part of the indus making it a sight worth jotting down in your memory book the indus is bright blue the zanskar is muddy the mighty river indus originates in tibet enters ladakh region of india flows through kashmir amp enters pakistan where it ends it 's journey by emptying into the arabian sea near karachi it has many tributeries some of which are big rivers themselves one of the world 's oldest civilization the indus valley civilization grew up in its valley about 0 years back the suru and zangskar valleys form a great trough at the foot of the northern heavily glaciated flank of the himalayas while opposite rise the mountains of the zanskar range the suru river forms the western and northern boundary of the zanskar range the suru after receiving the combined waters of the dras and shingo rivers a short distance north of kargil joins the indus at marol in baltistan which is now on the pakistan side of the line of control the zanskar river is a north flowing tributary of the indus in its upper reaches the zanskar has two main branches first of these the doda has its source near the pensi la 0 m 0 ft mountain pass and flows south eastwards along the main zanskar valley leading towards padum the capital of zanskar the second branch is formed by two main tributaries known as kargyag river with its source near the shingo la 0 m 0 ft and tsarap river with its source near the baralacha la these two rivers unite below the village of purne to form the lungnak river also known as the lingti or tsarap the lungnak river then flows north westwards along a narrow gorge towards zanskar 's central valley known locally as gzhung khor where it unites with the doda river to form the main zanskar river this river then takes a north eastern course through the dramatic zanskar gorge until it joins the indus near nimmu in ladakh thanks friends followers subscribers of sundeepkullu com for your warm wishes on this 0 0 0 birthday and making

7188740273 amusement lotte world bungee drop 0meters high at 0kph splendid seoul lotte world seoul south korea june 0 seoul has two theme parks lotte world and everland both located just 0minutes to an hour from the city center we only had time to visit one of them so we chose the one closer to the city lotte world lotte world is actually more accessible as there is a subway stop jamsil station just outside the complex for everland you would need to ride a bus apparently lotte world is not just a theme park its a whole complex of stuff a department store attached to a mall attached to hotel attached to a museum and so on we actually couldnt find the theme park entrance despite all the korean and hand signal instructions i was getting from the staff of the department store koreans are very helpful they try their best to help out but the language barrier is just real tough eventually a kind lady who we asked was actually very kind and went out of her way to bring us to the entrance as we went in june rainy season just started and so the indoor amusement park of lotte world the biggest indoor theme park in the world was a big plus it was actually a new experience walking around an amusement park and then every now and then realizing that the area is air conditioned and that you are actually indoors the ticketing system was not made easy unlike in disneyland to maximize their customer base they had tickets for entrance with ride all you can and for entrance only to lessen the hassle we got the ride all you can one but later found out that my 0 year old son who had free entrance had to pay extra for child only rides navigating through the amusement park both indoor adventure and outdoor magic island but especially indoor adventure was pretty confusing even with the map the numbering on the map was not smart at all imho and indoor adventure had 0 floors of activities that were marked on a 0d rendition of the park instead of per floor i eventually got the hang of it until we wandered into fantasy forest which much as i tried could not find on the map not that im complaining that there are extra stuff to do but now im wondering if i missed some things in my visit many of the signs and the shows we saw are in korean but it wasnt too much of a hassle as the map had an english version and the food for sale had drawings and all you had to do was point the lotte world staff is also proficient in english unlike the majority of koreans funny story was how we were able to get into the adventures of sinbad ride i was confused with all the map navigating that i thought it was a ride for 0 year olds apparently the attendant also got confused with our conversation about the babys age as well the ride was actually for 0 months or older looking at the map now a bit scary especially with the two steep drops steep for 0 year olds im sure but my little josh got through it without a single cry whew we had a fun time in lotte world and actually had the most relaxing day in our 0 day tour of seoul there were plenty of places to rest and we easily covered all the rides and shows that was suitable for a 0 year old kid in 0 0 hours despite all the diaper and eating breaks though i did not feel the disneyland feeling that i get when visiting disneyland feeling like a kid again like in a different land altogether etc lotte world is still a very good theme park with excellent facilities and tons of fun for everyone definitely world class and definitely a fun place to be

7312209080 awe mar 0 quality columns at the palaestra on what was the island of tyre al mina excavations the history of this part of the city once an island was as momentous as possible from the early 0st millenium to the 0s bc this was the greatest phoenician city at the time of the greatest phoenician achievements an impregnable island fortress widely considered unconquerable king hiram had an offshore fortress built on the island and it was from here that he ruled a maritime empire in the 0s bc that produced the best sailors the world had yet seen to explore further than anyone would until vasco de gama 0 years later passing the 'pillars of hercules ' at gibraltar rounding the cape of good hope according to herodotus and sailing north to wales to trade for tin their journeys which could be the greatest in ancient history began here they might have been inspired by hiram their 'sea king ' whose throne quot sat before large windows opening upon the sea and crashing waves quot and by the central importance of the worship of gods of the sea in phoenician religion melkart a principle phoenician deity was god of the sea and storms and baal was a son of the fish god dagon and a patron deity of mariners there 's evidence that sidon and byblos paid tribute to tyre as it grew in a period of egyptian decline and a lull in the procession of aggressive mesopotamian empires babylon was in eclipse and assyria was at rest the 0s bc would be remembered as a golden age until 0 and the return of assyrian aggression and dominance which would last until 0 and the destruction of nineveh it was from tyre that the phoenicians colonized much of the mediterranean establishing cyrene and sabratha in libya and colonies at cyprus rhodes crete malta sicily sardinia marseilles cadiz and of course carthage which became the greatest rival and threat that rome would face before the appearance of the huns tyre 's early history was so widely admired and romanticized that when the judaean authors of the old testament were glorifying david and solomon they made a point to portray them as hiram 's bffs who supplied plenty of cedar for the first temple which according to the bible solomon paid for generously with quot 0 cors of wheat and 0 cors of beaten oil quot to be paid every year 0 kings 0 0 0 and solomon later gave hiram a gift of 0 cities in the land of galilee quot hiram 's servants 'shipmen that had knowledge of the sea ' taught the sailors of solomon the route from ezion geber and eloth to ophir whence large stores of gold were brought to king solomon 0 ki 0 0 0 ch 0 0 f quot www bible history com isbe h hiram according to archaeologists no evidence has ever been found of the glorious early 0st millenium judaean kingdom described in the bible there is evidence however that david existed and founded a dynasty the tell dan stele refers to a king of the 'house of david' many modern historians now believe that after israel had been devastated by the assyrians in the 0s bc when sargon ii carried 0 israelites away into captivity the judaeans moved north into israel from the hills and took power there in a fashion israel became a client state of the assyrians and to justify or validate their rule there they created or expanded on their early history presenting david and solomon judaean chieftains or kings based in jerusalem then a town on the summit and slope of a hill as rulers of great empires of vast wealth romancing sabaean queens and hanging with the king of tyre a city which truly was a big awe inspiring deal at that time in the book of ezekiel yahweh speaks to king hiram as if quoting a good reference he had made for yahweh quot thou hast said i am a god i sit in the seat of god in the midst of the seas quot in the early years of judaism the jews rejected other gods and would only worship yahweh but they did n't deny the existence of other gods was ezekiel saying that hiram had worshiped yahweh if so i assume it 's to yahweh 's credit ezekiel and the authors of the old testament were in the habit of exalting yahweh this speaks to hiram 's reputation if that 's not enough ezekiel writes quot thou hiram hast been in eden the garden of god thou wast perfect in thy ways quot point made but then if it was believed in the 0s bc when the book of ezekiel was written that hiram had helped in the construction of the 0st temple 0 years earlier that could be sufficient basis for ezekiel and biblical authors to revere him any lebanese cedar used would have been purchased in tyre the southernmost phoenician city state so there could have been a connection between jerusalem and tyre if not with hiram directly it 's ironic if hiram is best known today for what the old testament authors wrote about him to give heft to david and solomon in the 0s bc david and solomon have long since returned the favour tyre was the home of queen jezebel wife of the israelite king ahab condemned for her worship of phoenician gods and of europa a princess abducted by zeus in the form of a white bull and taken to crete where she gave birth to minos who became king of the minoan civilization the first in europe which may be why europe was named after her the island withstood sieges by the babylonian king nebuchadnezzar and company and by the achaemenid persians phoenician sailing prowess was instrumental to the persian conquest of egypt earlier in the history of the persian empire until the incredible 0 month siege by alexander the great who built a 0 0 km long causeway to the island under cover of his innovative new catapults laid waste to tyre crucified 0 locals on the shore and sold 0 into slavery but as you can see here although tyre 's most glorious period ended with hellenism tyre continued as a great centre the roman ruins are impressive and the hippodrome here was the largest in the ancient world tyre continued to be a wealthy influential place through the byzantine period

7509411490 excitement battle for the triforce iii this is a piece that i have been somewhat actively working on since october but have had limited time due to other work however it is also part of a series of pieces featuring the same scene my last attempt done in 0 was lacking in many areas including overall accuracy and i felt that with the release of skyward sword all of the 0th anniversary legend of zelda stuff and the excitement of putting together my own dungeons amp dragons style table top zelda game it was about time to show off my skills again with a revival of this project another thing that also contributed to the creation of this piece was the release of high resolution official artwork from ocarina of time in particular that of ganon i could now get the accuracy i wanted and use the talent i had been honing throughout my time at the college for creative studies i can not even fathom the number of hours i 've spent on this but it is considerable the master sword and hylian shield alone took at least 0 hours each i was n't going to settle for anything short of perfection this time around everything in this image i drew from the ground up except for the manipulated ground and sky textures which were taken from photographs i also used textures to enhance the quality of metal leather cloth skin and horns for the art critics looking at this my desire was to portray the dread and anticipation of an epic battle with the king of evil reborn as a demon i think anyone who has played the game felt the same way when ganondorf rose from the dead and transformed into a monstrous beast before their eyes i 've seen many other depictions of the battle that are more action packed or stylized but my primary goal was accuracy providing a sense of nostalgia for that moment and recreating it in a way that gamers imagined the battle looking in real life for you die hard zelda fans out there you may notice a few things that are different the master sword i used is the design from twilight princess skyward sword mostly because it just looks so much more epic and finished than the simple design from ocarina of time also the scabbard is from the design of those games but this is mostly due the fact that i feel that nintendo has desired to make the new design canon since that scabbard design is in games that take place before and after ocarina chronologically link is also wearing chainmail beneath his green tunic which i felt would probably be more likely for an adventurer who is somehow able to withstand many enemy strikes and once again is present in tp ss navi actually has a physical humanoid body as opposed to a simple winged glowing orb fairies are clearly seen to have humanoid bodies in most of the other games as well as the great fairies within ocarina so i felt for realism 's sake navi should have a body i attempted to give a little bit of a quot forest fairy quot flair to her similar to the great fairies but lesser and finally i added the gerudo symbol to the golden gauntlets mostly because they were admittedly rather plain and i felt that since the silver gauntlets were found in the spirit temple and golden ones in ganon 's castle they might be of ancient gerudo origin themselves anyway please leave feedback and you can view the full resolution image on my deviantart

7933438222 excitement the story of an endangered gymnast this is our little girl emma rose out of five kids she is the only female we have she is second to last and she is the reason we had one more child we liked her so much that we thought it a good idea to try for another sweet angel it was then that little sam came along my wife likes to joke that if we had sam first he would have been our last we love all of our kids very much but sam is something else his story is one better suited for another time i am here to talk about miss rose from her start she has done well at everything she tried she was quick to walk and quicker than her older brother to master the bicycle her spirit is easy going her loves for the challenges of life were consistently quite evident she has always been a sweetheart one year ago she embarked upon the journey to become an expensive sweetheart how we signed her up for gymnastics my wife found a lovely gym somewhat close to us in the town of denver pa it is run by some really great folks including miss kristi miss barb and mister bob within one month of her beginner class emma was moved up to a progressive class by march she was a level three and by may she was considered a pre level four by mid summer emma rose was a certified level four gymnast and her star was shining bright whenever my wife picked up our little girl from the gym her instructors had nothing but praise for her dedication to the sport they would say things like shes a natural and a great student we only have to show her something once and she gets it the problem is that each time our gymnast rose in the ranks so did the dollar amount required to keep her enrolled besides the basic fee for instruction we were now faced with the cost of uniforms and soon there will be competition fees whats a struggling daddy to do my bride and i wrestled with what should be done she asked me weeks ago to write a letter to our friends and family about the situation and to let them know a booster account has been set up for donations i resisted doing that because i am too proud for such a thing besides i make a comfortable living as a truck driver we dont live an extravagant lifestyle by any means since i think it is beneficial to keep my wife home while she raises our children in addition to that there are hungry kids and families in far worse situations than i am i suggested we give emma a break for gymnastics and my wife agreed when my wife told emma that we were considering that option tears welled up in her eyes i can not handle my daughter showing such emotion especially when those feelings are attached to a sport that she loves and one that i believe could teach her to be successful at other activities throughout her life maybe it was time to reconsider what my wife suggested i do in the first place leave my pride at the door and get to writing i honestly had no choice we never really told the people at the gym why emma hadnt been there were not really horrible people or parents we were simply trying to figure everything out one day miss barb called to inquire why emma rose hadnt been around my wife broke the news that we were really struggling with the monetary issues and were considering pulling emma from the program until we could afford to she also told miss barb that we were not expecting the cost to rise so quickly from 0 a month at the start to much more than that miss barb gentle soul that she is would hear none of that she told my wife that it was unacceptable not to have emma in gymnastics miss barb told my wife not to worry about the money and just get her back it was her gym she said and we would find a way to make things work she also said that if she didnt think that our daughter was worth it she would have let it go however she could not and with that emma returned my wife tells me emma gave miss barb a gigantic hug and jumped into mister bobs arms upon her return everyone including my wife were just about in tears i never wanted to pull my daughter from gymnastics during the small amounts of time that i am actually home its all she does yesterday i caught her doing some kind of flips on her bed and its never unusual to see her practicing routines in the open space of our living room i can not forget last week when her mother pulled into the driveway with emma in the backseat home from another visit to the gym i was sitting on the porch and emma came running up to me full of excitement and said daddy daddy guess what i learned today she told me it was some kind of back handspring thing i cant recall the actual name of what it was i am certain that if i tried it i would be immobilized for life all of these things demonstrate that emma rose has a real passion for gymnastics to be good at them and keep learning new routines are her dream its my duty as her daddy to nurture that dream and i will do the best that i can including asking for help if need be its not going to be easy the yearly expense at this moment is in excess of 0 the good news is that emma now has a booster account for donations from people that would like to help her i would like to extend my sincere thanks to the hoover family for donating three hundred dollars into emmas account they lost their daughter lexy very suddenly in february of 0 lexy was a level four gymnast like my daughter is now and shared my daughters love and dedication to the sport the hoover family set up a scholarship in their daughters memory its purpose is to help kids compete in a sport that their daughter loved who could otherwise not afford to do so my wife and i are blessed to have people like the hoovers in our life my heart goes out to them for their loss and for their dedication in honoring the memory of their daughter by doing something she enjoyed herself there is hardly any doubt that little lexy is smiling down from a cloud in heaven dancing in delight in watching her brothers and sisters practice and learn the sport that was so dear to her if you would like to contribute to emmas career as a gymnast the information on how to participate can be found below i have also created a facebook page for you to follow her progress i intend to add pictures of her in competitions and also let emma fill you in on her activities and thoughts you can find her page at www facebook com emmarosegymnast while the donations would be helping my daughter i think it is my duty as her dad to help her see the value in all of this as unlikely as it seems now there is a chance that she could encounter frustrations and struggles as her age and career move forward if those moments were to occur i will gently prod her to work through them her mother and i will remind her of how many people believed in her enough to help her arrive at whatever difficult moment she is contending with i will also make sure she understands the value of giving should she become more successful than all of our wildest dreams i will be there to congratulate her ill also remind her of the importance of helping others if she doesnt demonstrate the ability on her own i would also like to add that i have another plan that will benefit us all someday some gentleman might come to me and ask me if he could marry my daughter if i liked him enough i would answer sure as long as you pay back all these people that helped my daughter become the successful gymnast whom she is with 0 interest of course if he actually repaid the debt you would in fact make money on your investment a part of me hopes that he can not then my princess will be mine forever thank you for taking the time to read this story i only have one daughter in this world and i hope i have said everything right i have tried my best i learned it from my little girl if you would like to help support emma in her gymnast aspirations you may send a check payable to kb booster with emma 's name in the memo section to emma harry booster c o kb gymnastics 0

7950517898 awe the bugaboos alana approach ladder i had n't given too much though to the difficulty of the approach to applebee dome camp except for the ladder i dreaded the ladder on the way up and grew to dread it even more on the way down the ladder itself iwas n't very difficult but with a oversized top heavy pack weighing in at over 0 0rds my body weight it was a rather unnerving experience on top of that the top of the ladder was taken out by a avalanche this past winter now the top rung is even with the ground with only one support bar rising up less than a foot above ground level with the other being a jagged corner that 's the one under alanas left hand to navigate off the ladder safetly without risking tipping over backwards i chose to crawl off the ladder and along the ground until i could find a rock to help me stand up as it turned out this was the method of choice for most people i talked to during my stay in the bugs i could n't help but think about how hard and scary it was going to be to get back on the ladder on the descent the way down was pretty much as bad as i imagined it would be luckily i had some help by fellow hikers who helped hold the weight of my pack while i sketickly mounted the ladder i got down safetly but i 'm sure hoping they fix that ladder for my trip next year the bugaboos august 0 0 0 living in squamish i am very lucky to be surrounded by excellent rock to train my technical climbing skills as well as many great peaks for scrambling but until last week i had never had the opportunity to combine the two skills i 've been developing for years that all changed when a friend invited me to be her partner on the yearly trip my friend group takes two months after the invitiation a partner swap and a week of careful packing and preparation i actually found myself driving east about to embark on what would be the greatest adventure of my life to date the moment i arrived at basecamp my lofty climbing aspiration were downgraded to starting with a 0th class route and going from there i received tons of advice from friends that had been going for several years but still nothing could have prepared me for the reality of being there the ascent to applebee basecamp the scale of the spires the difficulty of the glaciers and the exposure did not translate well to maps and photos i found myself in awe and terror every single obstacle i encountered was more physically and mentally demanding that i could have expected even though we were with a large group of friends we were on our own when we headed out for the day and often learning as we went as a result we learned many lessons the hard way including when to put crampons on when to switch into rock shoes how hard preventing rockfall can be and all the ways rappelling can go wrong it was both the single most terrifying and rewarding experience of my life never did i expect to learn so much in a week or do so little actual climbing instead it was a wild ride of alpine obstacles and a truly life changing experience shared with great friends old and new a brief summary of my adventure aug 0 hike into applebee base camp with 0 lbs pack full of climbing camping and glacier gear as well as 0 days of food and clothes for everything from 0 to 0 degrees celcius rain and shine aug 0 eastpost spire combination of northeast and northwest ridges aug 0 crescent spire w ridge rained off first attempt after self arresting and improv anchor construction aug 0 crescent spire w ridge successful ascent followed by rappelling disaster involving ditching a rope that was later recovered aug 0 pigeon spire w ridge got 0m up route then turned back to save terror management skills for descent back down the bugaboo snowpatch col aug 0 eastpost spire again and bathing in the tarn aug 0 hike out and long drive home please feel free to contact me with any questions regarding my experience photos from this trip were taken with a combination of my nikon d0 olympus ut0 amp gopro hd0

muhammad s a w the glorious prophet of islam and on his companions and his followers tasawwuf quot there is no doubt that tasawwuf is an important branch of islam the word itself may have been derived form the arabic word quot soof quot wool or from quot safa quot cleanliness but its foundation lies in ones personal sincerity in seeking allahs nearness and trying to live a life pleasing to him study of the quran the hadith and the practical life of the holy prophet muhammad s a w and his faithful companions provide unmistakable support to this reality quot hazrat moulana allah yar khan r a sufism an essential part of islam doubts exist not only in the minds of the muslim faithful but also among the ulema notably the exoteric about tasawwuf and its votaries often they lead to misunderstanding as if shariah and tariqah were two separate entries or that tasawwuf was some obscure discipline foreign to islam or that it was altogether above the established laws and injunctions of our religion to help remove these misgivings and to reassure seekers as well as scholars our sheikh hazrat moulana allah yar khan r a sheikh silsila naqshbandia awaisia wrote al jamal wal kamal aqaid o kamalaat ulmai e deoband binat e rasool s a w daamad e ali r a dalael us salook ejaad e mazhab shia hayat un nabi s a w hayat barzakhia ilm o irfan niffaz e shariat aur fiqah e jaferia saif e owaisi shikast e ahdai hussain and tahkeek halal haram books biography sheikh allah yar khan was born in chakrala a remote village of mianwali district of pakistan in 0 he completed his religious education in 0 the very year he met shaykh abdul rahim who took him to the shrine of shaykh allah deen madni by divine will his spiritual connection was right away established with the saint of the 0th century hijra sixteenth century and he started receiving spiritual beneficence his sublime education in sufism signifying progressive spiritual growth and advancement continued for about twenty five years in 0 he was directed to carry out the propagation of prophetic blessings a noble mission that he accomplished with singular enthusiasm and devotion for a period spanning half a century anybody who visited him was duly rewarded with a share of spiritual bliss as per his her sincerity and capacity shaykh allah yar khan 's mission produced men and women of deep spiritual vision and distinction although hazrat moulana allah yar khan r a have lived a major portion of his life as a scholar with the avowed mission of illuminating the truth of islam and the negation of fallacious sects and this would appear quite removed from tasawwuf yet the only practical difference between the two namely the use of the former as a media to expound the truth and the latter to imbue people with positive faith nevertheless people are amazed that a man who until the other day was known as a dialectician and a preacher of islam is not only talking of mystic path but is also claiming spiritual bonds with the veteran sufi masters of the past this amazement is obviously out of place in the view of quranic injunction this is the bounty of allah which he gives to whom he wills 0 0 the purification of the soul the purification of the soul always formed part of the main mission of the prophets that is the dissemination and propagation of the devine message this responsibility later fell directly on the shoulders of the true ulema in the ummah of the last prophet muhammad s a w who as his genuine successors have continued to shed brave light in every dark age of materialism and sacrilege in the present age of ruinous confusion the importance of this responsibility has increased manifold of the utter neglect of islam by muslims has not only driven them to misery but also grievously weakened their bonds of faith in allah and his prophet muhammad s a w the decay in their belief and consequent perversion in their conduct has reached a stage that any attempt to pull them out of the depth of ignominy and the heedless chaos of faithlessness attracts grave uncertainties and apprehensions rather than a encouraging will to follow the shariah to purify the soul and to reform within the quranic verse layers upon layers of darkness 0 0 provides the nearest expression of their present state shariah amp sufism any action against the sunnah prophets way of life can not be called sufism singing and dancing and the prostration on tombs are not part of sufism nor is predicting the future and predicting the outcome of cases in the courts of law a part of sufism sufis are not required to abandon their worldly possessions or live in the wilderness far from the practical world in fact these absurdities are just its opposites it is an established fact that tazkiyah soul purification stands for that inner purity which inspires a persons spirit to obey the holy prophet muhammad s a w if a false claimant of sufism teaches tricks and jugglery ignoring religious obligations he is an impostor a true sheikh will lead a believer to the august spiritual audience of the holy prophet muhammad s a w if you are fortunate enough to be blessed with the company of an accomplished spiritual guide and sheikh of sufism and if you follow his instructions you will observe a positive change in yourself transferring you from vice to virtue islam as a complete code of life islam as a complete code of life or deen was perfected during the life of the holy prophet muhammad s a w he was the sole teacher and his mosque was the core institution for the community although islam in its entirety was practiced during that blessed era the classification and compilation of its knowledge into distinct branches like tafsir interpretation of the quran hadith traditions or sayings of the holy prophet saws fiqh islamic law and sufism the soul purification were undertaken subsequently this deen of allah passed from the holy prophet muhammad s a w to his illustrious companions in two ways the outward and the inward the former comprised the knowledge defined by speech and conduct i e the quran and sunnah the latter comprised the invisible blessings or the prophetic lights transmitted by his blessed self these blessings purified the hearts and instilled in them a passionate desire to follow islam with utmost love honesty and loyalty whats sufism sufism is the attempt to attain these barakah blessings the companions handed down prophet muhammad s a w teachings as well as blessings to the tabaeen their strong hearts were capable of infusing these blessings into the hearts of their followers both aspects of islam were similarly passed on by the tabaeen to the taba tabaeen the compilation of knowledge and its interpretation led to the establishment of many schools of religious thought famous four being the hanafi the hanbali the maliki and the shafa'i all named after their founders similarly in order to acquire safeguard and distribute his blessings an organized effort was initiated by four schools of sufism the naqshbandia the qadria the chishtia and the suharwardia these schools were also named after their organizers and came to be known as sufi orders all these orders intend to purify the hearts of sincere muslims with prophetic lights these sufi orders also grew into many branches with the passage of time and are known by other names as well the holy quran has linked success in this life and the hereafter with tazkiyah soul purification he who purified is successful 0 0 sufi orders of islam are the institutions where the basics of tazkiyah soul purification and its practical application are taught they have graded programs in which every new seeker is instructed in zikr e lisani oral zikr and is finally taught the zikr e qalbi remembrance in heart zikr e qalbi however in the naqshbandia order zikr e qalbi is practiced from the very beginning adherence to the sunnah prophets way of life is greatly emphasized in this order because the seeker achieves greater and quicker progress through its blessings the essence of zikr is that the qalb should sincerely accept islamic beliefs and gain the strength to follow the sunnah with even greater devotion if the heart is acquainted with allah and is engaged in his zikr then it is filled with barakaat e nabuwwat prophetic blessings which infuse their purity in the mind and body this not only helps in controlling sensual drives but also removes traces of abhorrence voracity envy and insecurity from human soul the person therefore becomes an embodiment of love both for the divine and the corporeal this is the meaning of a hadith there is a lump of flesh in the human body if it goes astray the entire body is misguided and if it is reformed the entire body is reformed know that this lump is the qalb pas anfas recent history khawajah naqshband d 0 ce organized the naqshbandia order at bukhara central asia this order has two main branches the mujaddidia and the owaisiah the former is identified with sheikh ahmed sirhindi known as mujaddid alif sani literally reviver of the second muslim millennium a successor to khawajah baqi billah who introduced the order to the indo pakistan sub continent the owaisiah order employs a similar method of zikr but acquires the prophetic blessings in the manner of khawajah owais qarni who received this beneficence from the holy prophet muhammad s a w without a formal physical meeting the zikr employed by the naqshbandia is zikr e khafi qalbi remembrance of allahs name within the heart and the method is termed pas anfas which in persian means guarding every breath the chain of transmission of these barakah of course emanates from the holy prophet saws spiritual baiat oath of allegiance it is necessary in all sufi orders that the sheikh and the seekers must be contemporaries and must physically meet each other for the transfer of these blessings however the naqshbandia owaisiah order goes beyond this requirement and sufis of this order receive these barakah regardless of physical meeting with their sheikh or even when the sheikh is not their contemporary yet it must be underscored that physical meeting with the sheikh of this order still holds great importance in dissemination of these barakah sheikh sirhindi writes about the owaisiah order in his book tazkirah it is the most sublime the most exalted and the most effectiveand the highest station of all others is only its stepping stone by far the greatest singular distinction of the naqshbandia owaisiah order is the honor of spiritual baiat oath of allegiance directly at the blessed hands of the holy prophet muhammad s a w sheikh hazrat moulana allah yar khan r a the reviver sheikh allah yar khan was

command its food is the light of allah or the divine refulgence which it acquires from the realm of command through the holy prophet muhammad may allahs choicest favors and peace be upon him whose status in the spiritual world is like that of the sun in the solar system the quran refers to him as the bright lamp indeed he is the divinely selected channel of all barakah all exalted messengers themselves receive these barakah from him lataif the human ruh also possesses vital organs like the physical body through which it acquires its knowledge food and energy these are called lataif singular latifah subtlety scholars of various sufi orders have associated them with specific areas of the human body the naqshbandia owaisiah order identifies these lataif as follows first qalb this spiritual faculty is located within the physical heart its function is zikr its strength increases ones capacity for allahs zikr second ruh the site of this latifah which is a distinct faculty of the human ruh is on the right side of the chest at the level of qalb its primary function is concentration towards allah third sirri this is located above the qalb and functions to make possible kashf forth khaffi this is located above the ruh and functions to perceive the omnipresence of allah fifth akhfa this is located in the middle of chest at the centre of the first four lataif and makes it possible for the ruh to perceive the closeness of allah who is closer to us than our own selves sixth nafs this latifah is located at the forehead and functions to purify the human soul seventh sultan al azkar this latifah is located at the top centre of the head and serves to absorb the barakah of allah into the entire body so that every cell resonates with zikr five exalted messengers of god there are five exalted messengers among the many known and unknown messengers of allah they are hazrat muhammad hazrat nuh noah hazrat ibrahim abraham hazrat musa moses and hazrat esa jesus peace be upon them all hazrat adam is the first prophet of allah and the father of mankind each latifah is associated with a particular prophet the barakah and lights from hazrat adam peace be upon him descend on the first latifah qalb its lights are reflected from the first heaven and are yellowish the second latifah is associated with hazrat nuh and hazrat ibrahim peace be upon them its lights descend from the second heaven and appear as golden red the lights descending upon the third latifah are from hazrat musa peace be upon him and are white one the fourth latifah the lights of hazrat esa peace be upon him descend from the fourth heaven and are deep blue the fifth latifah receives its barakah directly from the holy prophet muhammad may allahs choicest favors and peace be upon him the lights associated with this latifah are green descend from the fifth heaven and overwhelm all the first four lataif the lights descending upon the sixth and seventh lataif are the divine lights whose color and condition can not be determined these are like flashes of lightening that defy comprehension if allah blesses a seeker with kashf he can observe all of this the vision is slightly diffused in the beginning but gradually the clarity improves sulook stages of the path after all seven lataif of a seeker have been illuminated with divine lights through tawajjuh of the sheikh and his ruh has acquired the ability to fly the sheikh initiates its journey on the sublime path of divine nearness the path is known as sulook and its stages are not hypothetical imaginations but real and actually existing stations on the spiritual path these are also referred to as meditations because a seeker mentally meditates about a station while his her ruh actually ascends towards it the first three stations that form the base of whole sulook are described as ahadiyyat a station of absolute unity of divinity it is above and beyond the seven heavens it is so vast a station that the seven heavens and all that they encompass are lost within ahadiyyat as a ring is lost in a vast desert its lights are white in color maiyyat station denotes divine company he is with you wherever you might be this station is so vast that ahadiyyat along with the seven heavens beneath are lost within it as a ring is lost in a desert its lights are green in color aqrabiyyat station denotes divine nearness he is nearer to you than your life vein again aqrabiyyat is vast as compared to maiyyat in the same proportion its lights are golden red and are reflected from the divine throne it is indeed the greatest favor of almighty allah that he blesses a seeker with an accomplished sheikh who takes him to these sublime stations the final station that a seeker attains to during his her lifetime becomes his her iliyyeen blessed abode in barzakh and his her ruh stays at this station after death zikr why is zikr necessary for everyone allah ordains every soul in the quran to perform zikr this not only means reciting the quran and tasbeeh but also zikr e qalb it is only through zikr e qalbi that prophetic lights reach the depths of human soul and purify it from all vice and evil zikr infuses a realization of constant divine presence and a seeker feels great improvement in the level of sincerity and love towards allah and the holy prophet saws such levels of sincerity love and feelings of divine presence can never be obtained without zikr it would be a mistake to believe that zikr may be a requirement only for the very pious and virtuous people zikr provides the prophetic blessings which are in effect the life line of every human soul it transforms even the most corrupted humans into virtuous souls by bringing out the best in them the fact is that zikr is the only way to achieve true contentment and satisfaction in life the holy quran has pointed to this eternal fact that it is only through zikr allah that hearts can find satisfaction such satisfaction and peace are the ultimate requirements of every person regardless of religion race and ethnicity practicing zikr regularly removes all traces of anxiety and restlessness and guides the human soul to eternal bliss and peace

8057183319 amusement bucking red ryder off my mind is like a steel trap once something gets trapped inside it usually ends badly for that something next year 's carney will put an end to this grief this exposure was zoomed during it 's duration but i think that the shakes over the exposure time produced the bead work effects i had to do some warping to present it the way i wanted and i do n't care if the viewings are down a bit on the carney rides i had a max of fun shooting and they were a breeze to edit especially for me i get mostly muted colors in the ag settings i have shot so i revel in just colors and this title does have a nice touch for the actual scene do n't you think must be an effect of a couple of the carneys i met down there somehow all my shooting before sunset was garbage after was a kick and me there hand held without my tripod and nothing to do but experiment i figured exposure was no sweat if i was taking images of colored lights as exposures grew slower i opened the monster lens but in fact that is a mistake so i crept back up to f 0 and f 0 the new plan is to start slowing the shutter down and i got as slow as 0 seconds which ended up being the key at 0 iso i could then pan the camera and jiggle the camera at will it seems that jiggling the camera at 0 seconds is not a problem as you can see it is more difficult zooming full range when the shutter is open and the camera hand held a tripod might help on zoom at the sacrifice of spontaneity a piece of foam on top of the tripod might serve to rest the lens shade and then manipulate the zoom i completely forgot to try racking the focus during exposures and i certainly did n't get enough pans and blips imho another effect was that i never tried multiple exposures apparently colors and saturations are in the bag with digital sensors and i have certainly seen my share of over saturated scenes from folks who have never been concerned about color space the real goal is to find angles that maximize the balances of the lights in the frame look for complexity and combinations it 's hard to capture three rides active at the same time five impossible this is what i learned go from there place lights in the middle of the frame but you best have no expectations except balance where ever your goose is cooked there the jiggles add the action this is the ferris wheel and the other rides in action while the lens was being vertically sort of i 'd like to think there is a fraction of the creativity of i still believe in u i am trying at least i got a chance to shoot colors instead of subtleties like anoop negi in goa that 's fun

8095882543 sadness blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness day 0 i had to use this quote somewhere it 's from one of my favourite movies and arguably one of the best tarantino flicks around certainly a classic i think the quote fits this shepherd hehe perfectly as almost everyone knows these dogs will lay by your side in your darkest hour they will lick your wounds seeping sadness and dry your eyes with their coat and best of all look at you in the morning like you never faltered unlike children they will think the world of you for their entire life from the time they enter this world as tiny cashmere balls of energy until the day that they lay their gray beard upon your lap and let out one final cathartic sigh they will idolize you and literally live to serve you it 's pretty obvious why they 're referred to as man 's best friend but you do n't truly understand that concept until it 's too late and you 've watched a lifecycle begin and come to a tragic end all in the span of your childhood but like any experience you do not truly understand it until you have overcome the situation sadness and grieving as a child is invaluable as there will surely be a time later in life where one will be forced to reconcile with death and loss nothing lives forever and furthermore to speak very generally to have a set of preconceived notions or ideas is a very dangerous thing yes it may saturate our lives with confidence and reality but it also inhibits our creative abilities as well as creates a barrier of which must be crossed in order to experience change or growth growth is change and vice versa once one achieves the realization that change is unavoidable and alteration of our perceived reality is inevitable we can begin to be at peace the most difficult part though is being able to accept that limitations most likely do not exist speaking small scale of course they exist for example the world is only so large well yes technically the earth has a specific volume but to speak of the world as everything the only thing we know for sure is that we do not know and that there is an observable universe this concept shattered my perception upon researching how possibly infinite space is to think that while we sit in our house of a set size there is an encasing around us that potentially continues forever is unsettling but when you really look at it our body is just a shell for our brain our brain is a shell for every emotion thought perception speculation and concept that we deem as tangible in a figurative sense and even further those thoughts feelings and perceptions are a shell for our subconscious that almost seamlessly dictates the manner in which each of these things come to light within an individual so does that mean that the innermost 'object ' is actually in control of every larger 'object ' for without that nucleus so to speak there is nothing it is all very concerning and these topics of unprofessional angst ridden philosophy that i find myself pondering and growing frustrated with perhaps even mildly insane at times since i repeatedly put myself in a paradoxal state of mind that leads me into circles with no plausible answer in sight are what we will come to understand as society as a greater mass in the future i think you could always say that the answer to my madness is accepting and consciously stating that i know nothing now that is only true in context and in terms of perspective of course but does that mean that since i have come to a conclusion that there is in fact a conclusion and if there is a conclusion then i am not in fact insane but for an individual to claim their own sanity is often to be insane and with that concept in mind i am sent back into a spiralling frenzy of thought discrediting my theories but also proving the theory that we compared to our perceived infinity know nothing and that we are responsible for influencing anything we choose or desire to influence with infinite possibility anyway i took this shot in niagara as well yesterday after touring a winery and met this friendly dog at a garden centre run by a quaint pair of seniors who undoubtedly have channeled their inner cozy ness to create a store which creates the feeling of just that one would feel at home just by stepping foot indoors from the cats and dogs to the clich coasters displaying messages of encouragement it was home for these two

the black mere of morridge in the staffordshire moorlands blake mere or black mere is a small pond of irregular shape lying in a little hollow on the summit of the high hill of morridge about three and a half miles e n e from leek a visit to it in summer is pleasant enough but in winter and when the mists of november beset the traveller as he passes the spotwhen the cutting winds howl fiercely through the gloomy heaththe pool naturally dark appears black as night and leads him to term it that lake whose gloomy shore skylark never warbles oer such indeed was the horror in which the black mere was held by our ancestors and such their strange beliefs connected with it that i have thought it well they should be preserved in the pages of the reliquary camden quoting nicham says it is a lake that with prophetic noise doth roar where beasts can neer be made to venture oer by hounds or men or fleeter death pursued theyll not plunge in but shun the hated flood dr plott however in his history of staffordshire saysthe water of the black meer is not so bad as some have fancied and i take it to be nothing more than such as that in the peat pits though it be confidently reported that no cattle will drink of it no bird light on it or fly over it all which are as false as that it is bottomless it being found upon admeasurement scarce four yards in the deepest place my horse also drinking when i was there as freely of it as ever i saw him in any other place and the fowls are so far from declining to fly over it that i spoke with several that had seen geese upon it so that i take this to be as good as the rest notwithstanding the vulgar disrepute it lies under but this place has yet far more terrible associationshark says a manuscript0 now lying before mehark what a shriek of agony what an appalling scream what a soul sickening note of despair heavens tis a womans voice that crys so loudly for aid her very throat seems cracking with the intensity of her efforts louder louder grows the scream and then a fearful gurgle sudden and instant stays the hideous sound yet the stillness is more ominous than the hitherto frightful din not a sound not a murmur the senses stunned and palsied by the piercing cry are now awe stricken at the deathlike silence which succeeds but hark hark it comes againquick like a thunder clap it is repeated in all its former agony the air is filled with the re vibrations of that wild outcry horribly distinct the shriek becomes deafening in the extreme the voice is unansweredno other tongue speaks but that despairing one yet it cries as though some were near to hear it it appeals as if those were present who could relieve its terror again the cry is suddenly hushed a confused murmur as of one calling from beneath thick folds of cloth wrapped over the mouth is heard and then silence deep and deathlike prevails but again again the head escapes the barbarous hand again the mouth is clear the tongue moves the shriek is repeated echo sends back the cry it resounds from all sides and the air is fraught with the deafening screamhelp help mercy mercy the cries are quickly stifled the voice is mute the tongue dumb yet the hoarse hollow cry once more faintly sounds and the low smothered guttural whisper bears the same burden help help mercy mercy 0 that the slave had forty thousand lives one is too poor too weak for my revenge shakespeare this event is thus ably narrated by the venerable historian before quotedamongst the unusual accidents that have attended the female sex in the course of their lives i think i may also reckon the narrow escapes they have made from death whereof i met with one mentioned with admiration by every body at leek that happened not far off at the black meer of morridg which though famous for nothing for which it is commonly reputed as that it is bottomless no cattle will drink of it or birds fly over or settle upon it all which i found to be false yet it is so for the signal deliverance of a poor woman enticed hither in a dismal stormy night by a bloody ruffian who had first gotten her with child and intended in this remote inhospitable place to have dispatched her by drowning the same night providence so ordering it there were several persons of inferior rank drinking in an alehouse0 at leek whereof one having been out and observing the darkness and other ill circumstances of the weather coming in again said to the rest of his companions that he were a stout man indeed that would venture to goe to the black meer of morridg in such a night as that to which one of them replying that for a crown or some such summe he would undertake it the rest joining their purses said he should have his demand the bargain being struck away he went on is journey with a stick in his hand which he was to leave there as a testimony of his performance at length coming near the meer he heard the lamentable cries of this distressed woman begging for mercy which at first put him to a stand but being a man of great resolution and some policy he went boldly on however counterfeiting the presence of divers other persons calling jack dick and thom and crying here are the rogues we lookd for which being heard by the murderer he left the woman and fled whom the other man found by the meer side almost stript of her clothes and brought her with him to leek as an ample testimony of his having been at the meer and of gods providence too this meer is also termed the mermaid pool from an old tradition that one of those fabulous creatures dwells in it in fact some of the peasants thereabout are ready to swear that when some years ago the pool was partially let off one appeared predicting that if the water were allowed to escape it would drown all leek and leekfrith this vain idea has given origin to the sign of a neighbouring roadside inn the mermaid a place frequently visited by sportsmen when shooting in the vicinity

8305630222 contentment have a joyful christmas it has been a tough year this year though we survived the alleged mayan apocalypse there were many tragedies and calamities some too heartbreaking to contemplate and some at a scale that affected millions but the christmas story itself is anchored in tragedy when god came down to earth and became man in the form of the baby jesus there was a bloodbath and massacre of children initiated by a jealous ruler that 's one reason why i like to think of joy as the heart of the season not happiness joy is something that can only be acquired by those who have not only experienced happiness but have endured pain and tragedy coming through it and arriving at a place of fulfillment and contentment joy exists not without pain not even in spite of it but it is been forged out of pain like gold in a smelting pot the fire of circumstance eliminating the dross from our lives and helping us focus on that which is truly shining and valuable and eternal so may you find and celebrate joy this seasonno matter what you have endured

8382298869 awe you do n't create art art happens 0d 0mm press l for a much better view this was shot in the morning at about 0am in west kalimantan borneo i was there for a mission trip with some friends we had arrived after a grueling 0h bus ride grateful for the chance to escape from the stressful pace of urban life and to do something meaningful for people in need it had stormed the day before and the night sky was concealed by thick cloud cover and fog to be honest nobody expected a nice sunrise i had spotted the beginnings of a rainbow soon after the sun came up but it was nothing spectacular the clouds were still thick and a dull grey washing out any blue in the sky all that we could make out from the rainbow was a tiny arc at one corner of the scene and i decided that it was n't worth the memory space and battery life to capture the scene then however after breakfast a friend came shouting for me quot you 've got to see this quot so i did and that one glimpse was enough to convince me to sprint back towards my room to grab my wide angle lens the rainbow was stretched across the landscape in its full glory truly it was something special something i knew not everyone got to see in a lifetime i am proud to say that this turned out to be one of my favorite pictures the double rainbow stretches across a vast stretch of hilly primary forest the three crosses at the bottom frame are symbolic of christianity the faith of the village we were helping out in adding a spiritual feel to the photograph the clouds were fluffy and neatly divided into 0 balanced parts and they also formed nice lead in lines from the top corners adding depth to the photograph the sun was still low in the sky and almost right behind me revealing interesting textures of the hilly landscape the exposure was also much more manageable with the sun out of the composition and the skies were more saturated with blue the blue sky peeked through the cloud cover just enough to add drama but not too much as to distract from the delicate hues of the rainbow indeed i was in awe of the spectacular sight before me a reminder of what a wonderful world we live in and how blessed we all are i am very thankful for the chance to witness and capture that moment my new facebook page all rights reserved use without permission is illegal

8606235336 anger reign of terror brutality of bnp jamat it was 0 0 pm on 0st august 0 when awami league chief sheikh hasina was wrapping up a rally protesting sylhet blasts a wave of grenade attacks on her left at least 0 people killed and left around 0 persons critically injured including top awami league leaders abdur razzak amir hossain amu suranjit sengupta ivy rahman and kazi zafarullah the party secretary on women affairs ivy rahman died in the hospital later in the day the unknown assailants fired seven bullets at the bulletproof suv that hasina boarded immediately after the blast the unusually poor deployment of police at the rally and the absence of forces on nearby building rooftops are a remarkable deviation from the usual practice motaher hossain general secretary of al krishak league said some people on the roof of ramna hotel and adjacent building were throwing bombs at least 0 grenades exploded one after another and also who were present on the spot told a white microbus carried of some injured person who were among the assailant and were wounded by their own bomb blame game started at the very moment hasina spoke out loud about governments conspiracy to kill the remaining member of bangabandhu sheikh mujiber rahmans remaining family members bnp leaders hold back and abdul mannan bhuiyan commented that they have blamed the government out of emotion but soon bnp leaders changed their tone and started to blame al for attacking their own rally they argued al had done it to destabilize the country and discredit the government only to grab the power fiction and conspiracy theories were put forward by various columnists in the media pro awami columnists blamed the fundamentalist forces and the right wing coalition government for this attack while pro bnp columnists blamed al and pointed finger towards the countrys biggest neighbor india however most columnists inclined towards awami league and left parties and leaders and activists of these parties discovered a pattern in the bomb blasts in most cases secular forces and those who believe in culture tradition and democratic values had been the target the same group was behind the attack on hasinas rally those pro bnp columnists pick up the same incident and argued hasina was not the target of those assailants if she were their target then why none of those grenades fall on the truck and also wrote thousand pages about als possible motive behind this some suspected it as a plot by international muslim extremist groups some pointed towards the association of isi inter services intelligence while jamaat leader matiur rahman nizami believes it is the work of well known enemies of islam who masterminded through various covert organizations to carry out such brutal murders it became increasingly hard to dig out the truth from these fictions with conspiracy theories you can use any piece of evidence to either prove or disprove your opinion and you can pick up any particular incident to strengthen your position truth has many faces but with conspiracy theory all you can achieve is a thousand shade of the truth and all these are equally probable and could be equally false in this present regime we have finally a charge sheet that clearly indicates awami leagues position is correct in this issue rab and other government intelligence agency finally concluded that islamic militants are behind this attack and also a small fraction of bnp activists patronized this attack but is it the whole truth or only a facade lets look at the proceedings of the investigations to investigate 0st august 0 bomb blast then bnp government first employed metropolitan polices detective branch to investigate this incident then this case was handed over to the criminal investigation department of bangladesh police five investigating officer under 0 officers in charge investigated this incident for over 0 years and they had submitted two charge sheet contradicting each other what is the progress in this case when ever you ask this question to a law enforcement officer a certain reply will be that we are still investigating this matter we had some lead but for the sake of this on going investigation we can not tell you anything even after submitting charge sheet against 0 person in june 0 0 and acquitting all other person found guilty on the first charge sheet presented by the cid still the investigation has not been closed so far we have 0 persons who claimed that they had actively participated in this failed assassination on 0th june 0 joj miah from noakhali confessed to police that for 0 taka he carried out this attack under the order of subrata bain a top terrorist subrata bain and his group had close ties with some notorious al leaders and they fled to india after alliance government took over the state in october 0 he confessed to a magistrate that he had never seen any grenade before but subrata bain joy molla masud ordered him to participate in this assassination asp of police cid abdur rashid was the investigation officer then but the government were not satisfied with this finding so led by munsi atikur rahman the investigation continued the investigation found a paved path established by the coalition government so far we have two investigation reports one of them was by justice jaynul abedin chairman of the one man investigation committee formed by the government to investigate 0st august grenade attack on awami leagues rally awami league has rejected this report claiming it lacks neutrality and another one was submitted by the supreme court bar association according to moudud ahmed who was law minister at that time claimed that this inquiry committee is illegal jaynul abedins investigation report justice jaynul abedin had submitted his 0 pages manuscript of coalition governments collective story on 0nd october 0 he was the member and chairman of one man inquiry committee formed by the government to investigate the grenade attack on awami league rally on 0st august on the eve of this submission those authorities in concern had invited journalist to give some insight of the report after scrutiny critical and painstaking analysis jaynul abedin did omit the possibility that coalition government and his ally some extremist religious group and a part of awami league was behind this heinous attack on awami league activists but he did claim with certainty that a foreign intelligence agency actively participated in this event they trained those assailants and equipped them with necessary ammunitions he described this event on that informal press conference this incident is a naked attack on the independence and sovereignty of the country because jaynul abedin was a bnp activist in the past awami league questioned the neutrality of the investigation committee even though 0 people given their statement to this committee but that does not include sheikh hasina who was the prime target of this massacre sheikh hasina rejected the call for her statement in that one and half hour informal briefing on the report prior to its submission jaynul concluded the commission may not have received cooperation from all which may have somewhat hindered the investigation but the inquiry is in no way incomplete like any other investigation report submitted by any government formed investigation committee it also embraced the fate to remain unpublished till to date the supreme court bar association scba inquiry committee report on 0nd august 0 immediately after the grenade attack the supreme court bar association formed an inquiry committee barrister kamal hossain was elected as the chairman of that committee and the other members of this committee were rokonuddin mahmud abdul malek amir ul islam m zahir and muhammad ayenuddin while hasina wrapped up the rally at that very moment a grenade went off loud and it was followed by at least 0 such explosions awami league leaders formed a human shield to cover hasina from the splinter they were injured in this process and soon after they escorted hasina to her bullet proof suv and hasina left for sudha sadan while on the move that suv was attacked by bullets witnesses on their statement confirmed the scba inquiry committee that they had not seen any member of the law enforcing agency in action there after inspecting the place of occurrence on 0th august 0 they went to sudha sadan where hasina assured the committee her full cooperation to find out the truth hasinas security personal and her driver gave their statement to this committee and this committee also inspected the suv driver on his statement told the committee that he drove towards the east then took a left turn and then he drove towards sudha sadan through zero point but police officers deployed at the rally on 0st august on their statement said to inquiry committee suv carrying sheikh hasina away from that place drove westward took a right turn and then went to sudha sadan through zero point on 0th 0th 0th september the committee watched the video tape recorded by atn channel i and ntv on atn video tape they saw a young man purposefully looking towards the multi storied dhaka city bhaban apart from this on channel i and ntv footage some suspicious incidents were seen by the committee members the inquiry committee sent two letters to prime minister khaleda zia requesting her to extend cooperation for the inquiry and to direct the law enforcing agency to cooperate with them in interest of its work a letter was sent from the inquiry committee to igp shahudul huq on 0 august 0 requesting him to direct the police authorities to inform the inquiry committee of the number of persons who were deployed for maintaining the law and order in the public meeting on 0st august 0 with the descriptions of their duties and locations after 0 weeks another letter was sent to him requesting for his interview the inquiry committee requested state minister of home affairs but all of them turned down their request further more the law minister moudud ahmed on several occasion said that this inquiry committee had no legal basis and any report of any such illegal committee should not be recognized but the government did inform the scba inquiry committee that they had done every thing that is possible for them and sent a copy of the statement made by the state minister for home affairs in the parliament in that speech the state minister mentioned that the police made all out efforts to identify the culprits immediately after the incident and within 0 hours a judicial inquiry commission was constituted with a judge of the supreme court as the sole member he also mentioned that the government also arranged for an international inquiry into the 0st august incident side by side with bangladesh police investigation and in response to the government invitation 0 three teams from interpol visited bangladesh and helped the inquiry besides this the government had also taken cooperation of fbi of usa the scba inquiry committee made repeated requests at the highest levels of the government for obtaining copies of reports of earlier bomb blasts the report of the judicial inquiry into the 0 august 0 constituted by the government and other documents and information but such requests have till to date were turned down the supreme court bar association scba inquiry committee concluded it was a pre planned attack carried out on the basis of a carefully prepared plan targeting sheikh hasina and other leaders and persons attending the rally the firing of the bullets and grenades on the vehicle by which she was leaving the place of occurrence confirms that she was the target the committee urged government to publish all reports of investigation within one month or else public may lead to believe attempt on sheikh hasinas life was to some extent was patronized by this government the alleged huji rage against awami league some columnists claimed in the media that the al government after assuming power in 0 barred islamic scholars from issuing fatwas through a high court order the government also came on strong against the right wing protesters and arrested hundreds across the country this had angered huji mufti abdul hannan the operative commander of the banned harkatul jihad al islami revealed on 0th november 0 i masterminded all grenade attacks across the country excepting the august 0 0 gruesome attack on the al rally and three people financed the outfit for carrying out the attacks hannan gave another detailed statement on 0st november 0 kajol was given the responsibility to collect funds and grenades for the attack they decided that 0 persons would carry out the attack and kajol and abu jandal would select the commanders of the operation it was decided that kajol and jandal brief the attackers about their positions and jandal would throw the first grenade after getting instruction from sayeed the others would throw their grenades at around the same time hannan said the attackers targeted the truck and left the spot individually after the operation however question remains as why huji chose to attack hasina after all those years and during the period when there was a row of political killings of awami league leaders kibria ahsan master etc were happening huji members were used but who masterminded the attack the bnp connection in january 0 former deputy minister for information of the bnp government abdus salam pintu was arrested for his involvement with the grenade attacks on awami league rally on august 0 in 0 he was arrested on the basis of confessional statement made earlier by detained mufti hannan who claimed that the attack on the al rally was planned at the official residence of the former deputy minister hannan said that pintu was present at the meeting and later supplied the grenades he made startling disclosure to interrogators about the involvement of former state minister of home lutfuzzaman babar and hawa bhaban in the grenade attacks from the new nation the cid officer said they were certain after the arrest of mufti hannan and pintu that the attack on the al rally had been aided and abetted by lutfuzzaman babar and the hawa bhaban to hide the truth former investigation officer ruhul amin a cid officer had gone to pintus house several times he said and added former state minister of home babar was involved in the entire process and pintu would regularly inquire with him about the progress pintus counsel advocate sanaullah mia however told he was implicated only because his cousin maulana tajul islam a militant leader and an accused in the grenade attack case had visited his house when pintu was a minister huji is the culprit but who used them and why on june 0 0 charges were finally made against 0 persons including top harkat ul jihad huji leader mufti abdul hannan and bnp leader and former deputy minister abdus salam pintu newspaper reports say cid chief additional inspector general jabed patwari said huji top leaders planned and carried out the attacks to kill hasina as a few arrested attackers said in their confessional statements that hasina would harm islam if she was alive and came to power again bnp leader pintu is not involved with huji but he has been charged since the attackers had held two meetings at his residence to take decision about the attack but the question remains whether huji tried to kill hasina on their own or it was a political assassination plot linked by bnp to take out the opposition like every other political massacre the 0st august grenade attack on hasina has no clear motive whatsoever and after 0 years of investigation we are not certain whether those who were behind this ghastly attack have finally been exposed will we be able to know the truth

member of bangabandhu sheikh mujiber rahmans remaining family members bnp leaders hold back and abdul mannan bhuiyan commented that they have blamed the government out of emotion but soon bnp leaders changed their tone and started to blame al for attacking their own rally they argued al had done it to destabilize the country and discredit the government only to grab the power fiction and conspiracy theories were put forward by various columnists in the media pro awami columnists blamed the fundamentalist forces and the right wing coalition government for this attack while pro bnp columnists blamed al and pointed finger towards the countrys biggest neighbor india however most columnists inclined towards awami league and left parties and leaders and activists of these parties discovered a pattern in the bomb blasts in most cases secular forces and those who believe in culture tradition and democratic values had been the target the same group was behind the attack on hasinas rally those pro bnp columnists pick up the same incident and argued hasina was not the target of those assailants if she were their target then why none of those grenades fall on the truck and also wrote thousand pages about als possible motive behind this some suspected it as a plot by international muslim extremist groups some pointed towards the association of isi inter services intelligence while jamaat leader matiur rahman nizami believes it is the work of well known enemies of islam who masterminded through various covert organizations to carry out such brutal murders it became increasingly hard to dig out the truth from these fictions with conspiracy theories you can use any piece of evidence to either prove or disprove your opinion and you can pick up any particular incident to strengthen your position truth has many faces but with conspiracy theory all you can achieve is a thousand shade of the truth and all these are equally probable and could be equally false in this present regime we have finally a charge sheet that clearly indicates awami leagues position is correct in this issue rab and other government intelligence agency finally concluded that islamic militants are behind this attack and also a small fraction of bnp activists patronized this attack but is it the whole truth or only a facade lets look at the proceedings of the investigations to investigate 0st august 0 bomb blast then bnp government first employed metropolitan polices detective branch to investigate this incident then this case was handed over to the criminal investigation department of bangladesh police five investigating officer under 0 officers in charge investigated this incident for over 0 years and they had submitted two charge sheet contradicting each other what is the progress in this case when ever you ask this question to a law enforcement officer a certain reply will be that we are still investigating this matter we had some lead but for the sake of this on going investigation we can not tell you anything even after submitting charge sheet against 0 person in june 0 0 and acquitting all other person found guilty on the first charge sheet presented by the cid still the investigation has not been closed so far we have 0 persons who claimed that they had actively participated in this failed assassination on 0th june 0 joj miah from noakhali confessed to police that for 0 taka he carried out this attack under the order of subrata bain a top terrorist subrata bain and his group had close ties with some notorious al leaders and they fled to india after alliance government took over the state in october 0 he confessed to a magistrate that he had never seen any grenade before but subrata bain joy molla masud ordered him to participate in this assassination asp of police cid abdur rashid was the investigation officer then but the government were not satisfied with this finding so led by munsi atikur rahman the investigation continued the investigation found a paved path established by the coalition government so far we have two investigation reports one of them was by justice jaynul abedin chairman of the one man investigation committee formed by the government to investigate 0st august grenade attack on awami leagues rally awami league has rejected this report claiming it lacks neutrality and another one was submitted by the supreme court bar association according to moudud ahmed who was law minister at that time claimed that this inquiry committee is illegal jaynul abedins investigation report justice jaynul abedin had submitted his 0 pages manuscript of coalition governments collective story on 0nd october 0 he was the member and chairman of one man inquiry committee formed by the government to investigate the grenade attack on awami league rally on 0st august on the eve of this submission those authorities in concern had invited journalist to give some insight of the report after scrutiny critical and painstaking analysis jaynul abedin did omit the possibility that coalition government and his ally some extremist religious group and a part of awami league was behind this heinous attack on awami league activists but he did claim with certainty that a foreign intelligence agency actively participated in this event they trained those assailants and equipped them with necessary ammunitions he described this event on that informal press conference this incident is a naked attack on the independence and sovereignty of the country because jaynul abedin was a bnp activist in the past awami league questioned the neutrality of the investigation committee even though 0 people given their statement to this committee but that does not include sheikh hasina who was the prime target of this massacre sheikh hasina rejected the call for her statement in that one and half hour informal briefing on the report prior to its submission jaynul concluded the commission may not have received cooperation from all which may have somewhat hindered the investigation but the inquiry is in no way incomplete like any other investigation report submitted by any government formed investigation committee it also embraced the fate to remain unpublished till to date the supreme court bar association scba inquiry committee report on 0nd august 0 immediately after the grenade attack the supreme court bar association formed an inquiry committee barrister kamal hossain was elected as the chairman of that committee and the other members of this committee were rokonuddin mahmud abdul malek amir ul islam m zahir and muhammad ayenuddin while hasina wrapped up the rally at that very moment a grenade went off loud and it was followed by at least 0 such explosions awami league leaders formed a human shield to cover hasina from the splinter they were injured in this process and soon after they escorted hasina to her bullet proof suv and hasina left for sudha sadan while on the move that suv was attacked by bullets witnesses on their statement confirmed the scba inquiry committee that they had not seen any member of the law enforcing agency in action there after inspecting the place of occurrence on 0th august 0 they went to sudha sadan where hasina assured the committee her full cooperation to find out the truth hasinas security personal and her driver gave their statement to this committee and this committee also inspected the suv driver on his statement told the committee that he drove towards the east then took a left turn and then he drove towards sudha sadan through zero point but police officers deployed at the rally on 0st august on their statement said to inquiry committee suv carrying sheikh hasina away from that place drove westward took a right turn and then went to sudha sadan through zero point on 0th 0th 0th september the committee watched the video tape recorded by atn channel i and ntv on atn video tape they saw a young man purposefully looking towards the multi storied dhaka city bhaban apart from this on channel i and ntv footage some suspicious incidents were seen by the committee members the inquiry committee sent two letters to prime minister khaleda zia requesting her to extend cooperation for the inquiry and to direct the law enforcing agency to cooperate with them in interest of its work a letter was sent from the inquiry committee to igp shahudul huq on 0 august 0 requesting him to direct the police authorities to inform the inquiry committee of the number of persons who were deployed for maintaining the law and order in the public meeting on 0st august 0 with the descriptions of their duties and locations after 0 weeks another letter was sent to him requesting for his interview the inquiry committee requested state minister of home affairs but all of them turned down their request further more the law minister moudud ahmed on several occasion said that this inquiry committee had no legal basis and any report of any such illegal committee should not be recognized but the government did inform the scba inquiry committee that they had done every thing that is possible for them and sent a copy of the statement made by the state minister for home affairs in the parliament in that speech the state minister mentioned that the police made all out efforts to identify the culprits immediately after the incident and within 0 hours a judicial inquiry commission was constituted with a judge of the supreme court as the sole member he also mentioned that the government also arranged for an international inquiry into the 0st august incident side by side with bangladesh police investigation and in response to the government invitation 0 three teams from interpol visited bangladesh and helped the inquiry besides this the government had also taken cooperation of fbi of usa the scba inquiry committee made repeated requests at the highest levels of the government for obtaining copies of reports of earlier bomb blasts the report of the judicial inquiry into the 0 august 0 constituted by the government and other documents and information but such requests have till to date were turned down the supreme court bar association scba inquiry committee concluded it was a pre planned attack carried out on the basis of a carefully prepared plan targeting sheikh hasina and other leaders and persons attending the rally the firing of the bullets and grenades on the vehicle by which she was leaving the place of occurrence confirms that she was the target the committee urged government to publish all reports of investigation within one month or else public may lead to believe attempt on sheikh hasinas life was to some extent was patronized by this government the alleged huji rage against awami league some columnists claimed in the media that the al government after assuming power in 0 barred islamic scholars from issuing fatwas through a high court order the government also came on strong against the right wing protesters and arrested hundreds across the country this had angered huji mufti abdul hannan the operative commander of the banned harkatul jihad al islami revealed on 0th november 0 i masterminded all grenade attacks across the country excepting the august 0 0 gruesome attack on the al rally and three people financed the outfit for carrying out the attacks hannan gave another detailed statement on 0st november 0 kajol was given the responsibility to collect funds and grenades for the attack they decided that 0 persons would carry out the attack and kajol and abu jandal would select the commanders of the operation it was decided that kajol and jandal brief the attackers about their positions and jandal would throw the first grenade after getting instruction from sayeed the others would throw their grenades at around the same time hannan said the attackers targeted the truck and left the spot individually after the operation however question remains as why huji chose to attack hasina after all those years and during the period when there was a row of political killings of awami league leaders kibria ahsan master etc were happening huji members were used but who masterminded the attack the bnp connection in january 0 former deputy minister for information of the bnp government abdus salam pintu was arrested for his involvement with the grenade attacks on awami league rally on august 0 in 0 he was arrested on the basis of confessional statement made earlier by detained mufti hannan who claimed that the attack on the al rally was planned at the official residence of the former deputy minister hannan said that pintu was present at the meeting and later supplied the grenades he made startling disclosure to interrogators about the involvement of former state minister of home lutfuzzaman babar and hawa bhaban in the grenade attacks from the new nation the cid officer said they were certain after the arrest of mufti hannan and pintu that the attack on the al rally had been aided and abetted by lutfuzzaman babar and the hawa bhaban to hide the truth former investigation officer ruhul amin a cid officer had gone to pintus house several times he said and added former state minister of home babar was involved in the entire process and pintu would regularly inquire with him about the progress pintus counsel advocate sanaullah mia however told he was implicated only because his cousin maulana tajul islam a militant leader and an accused in the grenade attack case had visited his house when pintu was a minister huji is the culprit but who used them and why on june 0 0 charges were finally made against 0 persons including top harkat ul jihad huji leader mufti abdul hannan and bnp leader and former deputy minister abdus salam pintu newspaper reports say cid chief additional inspector general jabed patwari said huji top leaders planned and carried out the attacks to kill hasina as a few arrested attackers said in their confessional statements that hasina would harm islam if she was alive and came to power again bnp leader pintu is not involved with huji but he has been charged since the attackers had held two meetings at his residence to take decision about the attack but the question remains whether huji tried to kill hasina on their own or it was a political assassination plot linked by bnp to take out the opposition like every other political massacre the 0st august grenade attack on hasina has no clear motive whatsoever and after 0 years of investigation we are not certain whether those who were behind this ghastly attack have finally been exposed will we be able to know the truth

wing islamist party sent us a clear signal of the growing strength of islamist politics these are happening at a time when an avowed secular party the awami league al is in power al won the 0 election with a commitment to amend the constitution to restore its secular character it also promised stern action against all forms of religious extremism and terrorism four years down the line much of those promises remain unfulfilled constitutional reform was half done islam remained a state religion religious parties are more organised today than ever before their student fronts are active in most educational institutions while islamists are active on political fronts more radical amongst them are organising themselves for terrorist activities as and when opportunities appear rise of islamic extremism in bangladesh on 0 december 0 we hoped that bangladesh would emerge as a modern democratic state the spirit of the nation was epitomised in the constitution 0 that adopted secularism as a state principle and prohibited the political use of religion the constitution barred the state from declaring any religion as state religion however it all changed after the killing of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman and many top ranking political leaders in 0 those who seized power at the time found the islamists as their political ally and started islamising the society and the state islamist political parties such as ji started building their party structures the power elites established thousands of madrassas that produced religiously indoctrinated youths who would be the front line activists of the islamist parties poor jobless students from the madrassas became easy target of the recruiters of militant islamist organisations by late 0s we had militant organisations such as jamiatul mujahedin bangladesh jmb and harkatul jihad al islami huji that took roots in bangladesh starting from 0 to 0 the militants bombed temples churches political rallies cultural functions cinema halls etc the government and the opposition kept on blaming each other for those attacks even when grenades attack was made on the al rally in dhaka on 0 august 0 killing 0 people and injuring the al chief sheikh hasina the government blamed it on the opposition the series bombing on 0 august 0 finally compelled the government to come out of the denial mode and stand up to the terrorist threat in 0 0 we saw a series of arrests prosecution and handing down of sentences including death sentences on some of the terror leaders since then there has been no major terror attack in bangladesh but that the terrorists are active is evident from the frequent arrests of activists and seizure of large cache of arms and explosives from their hideouts bulk of the islamic militants arrested so far had come from poor rural communities many were from the quomi madrassa background however recent years saw a new breed of extremists called the hizb ut tahrir hut hut members are drawn from children of urban upper income parentage educated in the mainstream or english medium schools and colleges hut is targeting the cream of our youth the nations future and therefore poses a clear danger it is feared that hut has penetrated among schools and universities professionals engineers doctors government officials and even among the security apparatus although the party was banned in 0 its clandestine activities continue in the country on the political front ji continued to grow in strength in bangladesh the party is small in size but highly disciplined well organised and has a well defined hierarchy jamaats aim is to establish a pure islamic state based on sharia the party had opposed the liberation war of bangladesh in 0 and actively collaborated in the genocide some of the top leaderships are now facing war crime trial the party therefore is on a back foot now but given the fact that a new election is around the corner its rank and file might align with the major opposition party to make a bid for power jis student wing islami chattra shibir islamic students front is now a potent student organisation from schools to universities the other islamist party of importance is islami oikyo jote islamic unity front a collection of small islamic parties like ji ioj also wants to establish an islamic state in bangladesh but there are differences in outlook ioj members are exclusively from quomi madrassa background and more traditional ioj has been in the forefront along with ji in the movement to declare ahmedia community as non muslims present governments attempt to register quomi madrassas and reform their curriculum was thwarted by iojs agitation none of the islamist political parties gave open support to the militant activities however many of the jmb and huji activists had previously been members of islamist political parties the islamist parties have multifarious social economic and financial investments some of the largest banks insurance hospitals diagnostic centres schools universities coaching centres and travel agencies are operated undercover by the islamist parties the islamist parties have been gaining in strength in bangladesh at the expense of the two major political parties bnp and al both parties at one time or other have been courting these parties in order to gain short term advantage over the other countering the extremists bangladesh government has taken a number steps to check extremism and militancy notable among those are anti terrorism act 0 and money laundering prevention act 0 as amended in 0 the two acts provide for deterrent punishment to offenders in case they engage in acts of terror or launder money to support terrorism based on a series of dialogues workshops and seminars participated by academics researchers politicians parliamentarians civil and military officials a national strategy to combat terrorism in the country has been proposed bangladesh has banned a total of six terrorist organizations including jmb huji and hut a number of islamic ngos have been banned who had terror links including revival of islamic heritage society kuwait rabita al alam al islami saudi arabia and international islamic relief organization saudi arabia muslim aid uk more than 0 militants were arrested most of them belonging to jmb huji b or hut 0 terrorist kingpins have been sentenced to death and many more sentenced to long imprisonment or are awaiting trial while our police action has been commendable we did not do enough on the social front we need to address urgently the problem of poverty ignorance and backwardness democratisation of the society is an insurance against extremist ideology we need to improve governance and provide access to justice for the poor and downtrodden we need to impart modern education to our youth that prepare them to face the challenges of a fast changing world a thorough overhaul of madrassa education in our country is long overdue we need an education system that produce people with high ethical and technical standards a system that encourages freethinking rather than rote learning emergence of hut points out a lack of pride and a sense of disillusionment among the children of affluent class this is because english medium schools where most of the rich parents send their children follow a curriculum that has no relevance to our culture history or traditions therefore english medium school syllabus too needs a thorough review government must legislate not to allow use of religion to gain political mileage we need to check creeping sudiaization of islam along with the money from the me donors comes the ideological package of wahhabi islam which is alien to south asia one of the prices we pay for the remittance from our labour force in the me is the influx of saudi brand of islam how do we de radicalise these migrant workers is a big challenge for us meanwhile hundreds of extremists who are arrested or under trial must be segregated from other prisoners at present these extremists are finding a captive audience 0 hours at their disposal busy recruiting new ones from among the prisoners we need to isolate the extremists and start a de radicalisation program so that when they return to the society they become useful citizen our effort to counter religious extremism must be supplemented by regional and global effort we need to have close cooperation and coordination between the governments of the region border monitoring passport control anti money laundering measures exchange of information on the movement of suspects arrest and deportation of fugitives are some of the areas where regional countries could cooperate checking of arms smuggling across the porous border is another area where regional cooperation is the answer in short a total comprehensive strategy has to be adopted for fighting religious extremism if bangladesh is to emerge as a modern democratic state the menace of extremism must be eliminated

8992554465 awe a millenium with god this is n't just a photo about a bridge though a fantastic bridge it is but also about a cathedral st paul 's to be exact cathedrals are such moving experiences you do n't even have to be all that religious to be transported by them i know because i do n't consider myself to be a terribly religious fellow at least not in that fashion yet one of the most amazing places i have ever stood is in the center of st peter 's basilica there is so much to be awed by on so many levels granted sometimes it strikes me as a bit incredible that religion can simultaneously propel us to build something as grand and majestic with more than a touch of hubris as well for spice as some of the chapels cathedrals mosques etc of the world while at the same time serving as a means or motivation for war oppression murder etc not to mention the history of how some of these cathedrals are built and paid for but that is that whatever it may be oddly enough despite that complicated mix of history that religion is always embroiled in or maybe because of it cathedrals have such power to them i have walked through st peter 's and st paul 's and notre dame and i can tell you it is near impossible to not be affected by the presence such buildings host even if i can not quite tell you why that is age mythos history hopes and prayers and optimism it is heady stuff and so i often seek them out when i am visiting far away cities because the ones in the u s are just not the same even if i do n't often make photos in them for a variety of reasons some things it is ok to not photograph but to just experience when i do photograph cathedrals and such it tends to be from outside and at a distance and so it was with st paul 's though i am bummed i missed being able to climb to the top by about 0 minutes in a couple of months i 'll be able to experience chartres and avignon and i am really looking forward to seeing both of those the hagia sophia is also on that list too but that will have to wait a couple more years i think but now i ramble not that i was n't to begin with

9283224558 awe contemporary glass tile cross our lady help of christians rc at kitt 's green in the tile cross area of birmingham is a stunning late 0s catholic church by richard gilbert scott and very inventive on a t shaped plan with a ribbed roof that curve upwards rising to form a central tower over the core of the building not everyone will find this attractive but i actually find it all the more remarkable for it copious quantities of stained glass is visible in the windows and weirdly shaped apertures but alas i was out of luck as it was all locked up there was a notice directing people wishing access to the church to the priest 's house behind it but i could tell my efforts were in vain as my appeal to look inside was met with a puzzled frown and a suggestion that i come back for mass the following morning he was perhaps busy which is fair enough but for me living nearly 0 miles away returning was n't so simple i was n't overly keen on looking around after a service the timings did n't suit my trains and it would be likely busy so when i saw 'confessions ' listed 0 0 saturday mornings thought that might be a better bet turned up to find the church was open but with a few people inc the priest i 'd met before who i did n't think would be overly keen to see me loitering again sitting or kneeling quietly inside i realised it was now exposition of the blessed sacrament instead a very awkward time to look around i 'd have to content myself with quietly keeping out of the way in the chapels at the back and get some pics of their windows at least but this was n't enough for one member of the flock who noticed me and glared in a 'how dare you enter our church ' kind of way i retreated out of sight into the baptistery to sit and look at a fine abstract window but he decided to come and stand staring aggressively opposite me and clearly wanted to start something but the atmosphere of awed silence prevented this and he left but he 'd made his point i knew i was not welcome in this church i left shortly afterwards myself feeling frustrated for the second time not having been able to view or record the full interior and deeply uncomfortable i was hoping to bump meet my would be assailant outside having mentally prepared some suitable biblical quotes about christian behaviour since he displayed so little of it but it was most likely just an all too common case of being judged guilty of whatever before proven innocent so to summarise this is one of the most remarkable modern church buildings i 've seen but from my experiences also just about the most unwelcoming i 've ever visited i 'm sure with hindsight staying after a mass would have been a far better choice after all reception might have been different certainly could n't be worse

9291930986 awe our lady help of christians tile cross our lady help of christians rc at kitt 's green in the tile cross area of birmingham is a stunning late 0s catholic church by richard gilbert scott and very inventive on a t shaped plan with a ribbed roof that curve upwards rising to form a central tower over the core of the building not everyone will find this attractive but i actually find it all the more remarkable for it copious quantities of stained glass is visible in the windows and weirdly shaped apertures but alas i was out of luck as it was all locked up there was a notice directing people wishing access to the church to the priest 's house behind it but i could tell my efforts were in vain as my appeal to look inside was met with a puzzled frown and a suggestion that i come back for mass the following morning he was perhaps busy which is fair enough but for me living nearly 0 miles away returning was n't so simple i was n't overly keen on looking around after a service the timings did n't suit my trains and it would be likely busy so when i saw 'confessions ' listed 0 0 saturday mornings thought that might be a better bet turned up to find the church was open but with a few people inc the priest i 'd met before who i did n't think would be overly keen to see me loitering again sitting or kneeling quietly inside i realised it was now exposition of the blessed sacrament instead a very awkward time to look around i 'd have to content myself with quietly keeping out of the way in the chapels at the back and get some pics of their windows at least but this was n't enough for one member of the flock who noticed me and glared in a 'how dare you enter our church ' kind of way i retreated out of sight into the baptistery to sit and look at a fine abstract window but he decided to come and stand staring aggressively opposite me and clearly wanted to start something but the atmosphere of awed silence prevented this and he left but he 'd made his point i knew i was not welcome in this church i left shortly afterwards myself feeling frustrated for the second time not having been able to view or record the full interior and deeply uncomfortable i was hoping to bump meet my would be assailant outside having mentally prepared some suitable biblical quotes about christian behaviour since he displayed so little of it but it was most likely just an all too common case of being judged guilty of whatever before proven innocent so to summarise this is one of the most remarkable modern church buildings i 've seen but from my experiences also just about the most unwelcoming i 've ever visited i 'm sure with hindsight staying after a mass would have been a far better choice after all reception might have been different certainly could n't be worse
9292804266 awe earth in transit the rain year clouds and clouds and clouds for the past 0 years or so there 's been a lot of talk and tension about climate change here on our planet we 've called it quot global warming quot the polar ice caps are melting at alarming rates the northern and southern extremes of the oceans are being markedly cooled with the inundation of polar ice that cooling is gradually making its way to the equator the cooling oceans will then change their currents and the weather follows suit if the gulf stream cools enough massive changes in weather will occur they already are make no mistake those changes are already underway it is no longer an abstract possibility we have seen the affects and will continue to see quot extreme ' weather as the earth recalibrates it 's currents and weather patterns yet another possibility has been offered as well these massive and powerful changes in the weather have ancient precedents they 've happened before global warming is not the final effect in iteself but is part of a larger cycle the warming period is a precursor to a cooling off in some cases this has resulted in ice ages in others longer more severe winters only it 's been suggested that once the warming period has melted enough polar ice to significantly cool and change water currents and air streams there 'll be a 0 0 year quot mini ice age quot this coming period as hypothesized could well be the best thing that 's happened to the earth in over 0 years even though the path there might be a bit dramatic the cooling oceans will be able to purify and refresh themselves this in turn re works and re vivifies the great winds of the planet it 's happened before it 's cyclical and it 's natural these images of a golden aftermath of one of the summer of 0 's larger thunderstorms are remarkable for the impressive amounts of mists and even quot clouds quot that rose up off the ground and filled the air as the sun was setting in the 0 years i 've been taking shots of sunsets off my balcony here i 've never seen anything like this it was awe inspiring and beautiful creating light and shadow effects that were quite rich and dramatic i 'm glad i was able to be home that evening and capture it music link david bowie quot warszawa quot from his quot low quot album 0 www youtube com watch v 0gy0n mcws july 0 0 tor view large on black

9311234754 fear the last man on earth american international 0 lobby card 0 '' x 0 '' starring vincent price giacomo rossi stuart antonio corevi emma danieli franca bettoja christi courtland carolyn de fonseca and umberto raho directed by libaldo ragona and sidney salkow i 'm not sure why this film is as underrated as it is spoiler alert this is an amazing depressing and in many ways brilliant film based on the richard matheson classic novel quot i am legend quot vincent price effectively conveys the terror and despair of being the last living man on an earth that is now overrun with vampires and or zombies the depiction of price 's day to day bleak existence is a moving and powerful thing to behold and the continual menace of the hordes of zombies is creepy in the same way as was later depicted in quot night of the living dead quot in fact as noted by others here one can not watch the scenes where the zombies lay siege to price 's boarded up house and attack his car without recognizing how close these scenes would later be copied by george romero in his classic zombie films if you are a fan of horror film history or just looking for a classic and unique film with an interesting story track down this lost gem robert morgan vincent price is the last man on earth as far as he can tell a plague killed everyone else on the planet several years ago he was immune to it and can only guess why vampires that were formerly human attack morgan 's home every night morgan 's days are spent shoring up his home against the vampire hordes picking up supplies in the abandoned city and eliminating his enemies by searching out and destroying the bloodsuckers while they sleep he maintains mirrors and garlic strands around his house and fashions stakes on his lathe to use on the walking dead he also conducts experiments on the bacteria that caused this plague in an effort to find a cure he remembers the early days of the plague when his former friend and lab partner ben cortman giacomo rossi stuart tried to warn morgan of what was to come morgan dismissed his fears and continued life as usual the vampires outside morgan 's home are led by ben cortman who has made it his personal mission to kill morgan quot morgan come out quot is the nightly chant that torments him he remembers the disease blanketing the earth his daughter kathy christi courtland fell ill and went blind his wife virg emma danieli was horrified and wanted to get help but any reported case of plague would result in immediate government pickup death and cremation of the body before leaving for work morgan ordered virg not to call anyone but tormented by the little girl 's cries she did as morgan arrived home he saw the government truck leaving kathy was gone his solitary existence is painful he gets on the radio every day calling out on different frequencies trying to find another human still alive in his tortured dreams he remembers when his wife returned from the dead to seek his blood after she succumbed to the plague because he could n't bear to throw her body in the cremation pit where others were taken he buried her himself and when she came back from the dead as a vampire he had to drive a stake through her heart one day to his amazement he finds a dog he is so excited to have a companion that he overlooks several signs that all is not right with the animal eventually he realizes that the dog is also infected and that he must kill it while burying the dog morgan encounters ruth collins franca bettoia a woman walking through the park in the sunshine even though he 's suspicious of her story of how she survived he takes her home with him she reacts violently to a garland of garlic cloves he brings out but she claims that she 's always had a weak stomach morgan catches her injecting herself with something and she 's forced to admit that she too is infected but that she and others like her have developed a serum that lets them control the disease by regular injections they keep the disease in check they are able to live in the daylight and do not turn to vampirism ruth also warns morgan that her people are coming for him because in his zeal to kill vampires he has been killing people like her who have the disease under control morgan injects ruth with some of his own blood and cures her of the disease completely his blood is the permanent cure that ruth and others like her have been searching to find at this moment however the soldiers come for him before ruth can tell them that morgan has found a cure he is surrounded and shot as he stumbles to his death he tells the crowds that they are freaks and that he is quot the last man on earth quot

9547664916 disgust catacombs catacombs montparnasse paris i decided that today was a day for going underground and i set off to montparnasse to visit the catacombs these are a vast maze of tunnels under paris originally used for quarrying the stone out of which the city 's main buildings are constructed in the late 0th century the state of the city 's churchyards had become so disgusting that the city removed the bones from all of them they were brought here at night the carts coming from the centre of the city accompanied by torch bearing acolytes and priests chanting the requiem mass a skull count showed that almost six million corpses were removed in this way they were buried deep underground but these people being parisians the skulls and bones were arranged in a neat and methodical way a meaningful chaos layers of tibia and femurs are crowned by a layer of pelvises and skulls and so on each churchyard was grouped together and a plaque shows which parish provided the skeletons the work was interrupted by the french revolution which provided plenty more corpses for when the work was resumed altogether about a kilometre and a half of tunnels were filled with the remains of dead parisians and you can walk through them on a winding route under the streets around montparnasse station in fact this is just a tiny fraction of the tunnels the catacombs extend for hundreds of kilometres under the city many of them rarely explored and difficult of access because of this they are regularly broken into by intrepid adventurers and many legends have grown up about parts of the network however my favourite story is one which is true in 0 a group of police cadets on a training exercise were given the task of tracking an imaginary criminal in a part of the network which was little known they got into the system through a manhole and when they were about a hundred feet underground something rather odd happened they triggered a motion sensor which set off the sound of barking dogs thinking that it was part of the exercise they headed onwards only to come out into a vast cavern which had been fully equipped as a cinema an anteroom had been equipped and fully stocked as a bar and there was also a film storage room when the cadets reported what they had seen the electricity board were sent in to work out where the invaders were getting their electricity from instead they found the wires all cut the equipment removed and a sign saying 'do n't try to follow us you 'll never find us ' perhaps the cineastes had got fed up with waiting to get into the system officially because this was the only place all week that i encountered a serious queue worse i was just in front of a small group of people who talked constantly in very loud voices she was an american who obviously lived in paris and they appeared to be young relatives who 'd come to stay she was taking them down the catacombs and the price to be paid for this by the poor kids was to suffer her pretentious nonsense she went on about spirituality and homeopathy and psychoanalysis and the inner energy and so on fair play to the kids they responded enthusiastically enough and then she got out some of her stream of consciousness poetry and started reading it in a loud voice well goodness me i was put in mind of something the graphic artist alan moore said when he was in hollywood helping turn his 'v for vendetta ' into a film and he was asked at a director 's lunch why he lived in northampton england quot because it keeps me grounded quot he replied and i thought that this was exactly right it was like the opposite of this pompous woman although to be fair to her i expect that if i went to live in paris i would also disappear up my own backside the catacombs are brilliant worth every minute of the queuing time worth every insufferable stream of consciousness adjective and then i went and did some shopping you can read my account of my travels at pariswander blogspot co uk

illumination equanimity peak of the dharma light of the universe perfect from the beginning en wikipedia org wiki union of the sun and moon text analysis of the union of sun and moon tantra nyid zla kha sbyor rgyud from the tibetan renaissance seminar background the tantra of the great secret union of the sun and moon nyi ma dang zla kha sbyor is one of the seventeen tantras rgyud bcu bdun within the nyingma rnying ma schools seminal heart snying thig tradition according to nyingma sources this tantra was first taught in india by garab dorje dga rab rdo rje who lived three hundred and sixty years after the historical buddha to manjusrimitra eventually it was transmitted to tibet the emporer trisong detsen hid the scripture in the eighth century and it was revealed as terma gter ma or treasure text by dangma lhngyel davidson 0 according to ronald davidson the written version of the seventeen tantras was most probably a product of the ch lce clan in the eleventh and twelfth centuries 0 the contents of this text deal with the teaching of the bardos bar do or intermediate states that all beings are subject to although the number of intermediate states ranges from four to six depending on the source the tantra of the great secret union of the sun and moon names five the bardo of nature the bardo of the state of samadhi the bardo of dream the bardo of birth and death and the bardo of existence this discussion on the bardos predates the more popularly known treatment of the bardos in the fourteenth century treasure text self liberation through hearing bar do thos grol character this tantra is in sangiti form in which the buddha dorje chang rdo rje chang skt vajradhara teaches esoteric buddhist doctrine to a bodhisattva orofino 0 the bodhisattva in this tantra is mitog thuba mi rtog thub pa who asks dorje chang a series of questions concerning how sentient beings can attain liberation in the various intermediate states most of the text is in verse summary the first section of this text discussing the bardo of present life rang bzhin bar do is not available in english translation it contains detailed explanations of a yoga system that allows practitioners to control and channel their physical and mental energies towards the goal of spiritual enlightenment orofino 0 the second section of the text is devoted to the bardo of death chi khaii bar do mitog thuba asks dorje chang to explain the signs of death and methods of preventing death if one sees these signs dorje chang discusses various signs of death for example if ones nose flattens out he will die in five days or if black spots appear on ones tongue he will die after two days orofino 0 0 he goes on to explain magical rituals that one can perform to reverse the course of death then the buddha in the dialogue suddenly switches from dorje chang to vajrasattva mitog thuba asks vajrasattva how one is to recognize the pure state of wisdom at the moment of death vajrasattvas reply begins with a description of the physical process of death at death the various elements of ones body dissolve into each other earth into earth water into water fire into fire and air into air each of these dissolutions is accompanied by a physical sign like the cooling of the body or the stiffening of the limbs the moment of death though also represents an opportunity to unify ones mind with the wisdom of the buddha thus achieving enlightenment this involves taking the quot position of the sleeping lion quot entering into a state of profound meditation and then directing the mind to the eyes in a moment of pure focus where pure awareness is concentrated into a single point the person achieves enlightenment and does not have to wander in the bardo this however is a very difficult task to perform vajrasattva outlines particular ways that a master or dharma brother can help a dying practitioner perform this task the third section of this text deals with the bardo of essential reality chos nyid bar do vajrasattva explains that during the bardo of essential reality one sees visions of the mandala of the five rays of light one sees quot subtle mobile trembling quivering scintillating quot masses of multi coloured light which shine quot disctinctly and marvelously quot one experiences the light from ones heart engaging with these visions finally one experiences the eight ways in which the light arises this represents an opportunity for liberation if one understands that these visions are manifestations of ones own mind one attains enlightenment if not one will be frightened and will enter into the next bardo the bardo of existence the final section discusses the bardo of existence srid pai bardo where the individual begins the process of being reborn into a new body in this intermediate state the individual sees visions of the six types of beings gods demi gods animals hungry spirits hell beings and humans one also sees visions of temples houses hoards of people desert land caves ruins and precipices the latter three visions represent future rebirth in a womb vajrasattva then describes the development of the fetus after the individual has entered into the womb and finishes by reminding mitog thuba that transmigration is an unending cycle that one can only escape through wisdom analysis and interpretation life and death one of the most remarkable things about this text is its treatment of the themes of life and death in our culture death is seen as a profoundly negative thing suffice to say death is not a preferred topic of discussion either in the public or the private sphere death represents failure the failure of the surgeon to fix a childs heart the failure of an individual to quot hold on quot to life or the failure of a cancer patient to quot beat quot the illness in contrast life is what people desperately hold onto and in their quest for eternal life people willingly spending large sums of money on face lifts anti aging creams and antioxidants in our culture we tend to focus on life and to be in a perpetual state of denial about death in the tantra of the great secret union of the sun and moon on the other hand life is not particularly glorified and death is not particularly belittled this text speaks of life and death in a candid and matter of fact sort of way in keeping with basic buddhist doctrine the tantra describes life as impermanent and invokes a series of similes life is like a quot dream quot quot rushing water quot quot wind quot quot magical enchantment quot quot illusion quot and itinerant quot pilgrim quot and a quot rain cloud quot that will pass over soon orofino 0 these similes convey a sense of the ungraspable nature of life no matter how hard we try we can never make things stand still the naturalistic similes of rushing water wind and rain clouds convey a sense of naturalness to the course of life while the similes of dream and magical enchantment convey a sense of the fleeting nature of both the things that we encounter in life and life itself the simile of the itinerant pilgrim conveys how life as much as we oftentimes celebrate it is a long and tiring journey despite this life is generally seen as an important moment for learning the buddhist dharma because it represents an opportunity where one can attain spiritual enlightenment buddhist tantric practitioners are also instructed to practice diligently during their lifetimes in order to take advantage of this opportunity thus although life is definitely not something entirely negative it is certainly not seen as something that is particularly extraordinary in the same way that life is not seen as something extraordinary death is also seen as a perfectly ordinary event the inevitably occurs over the course of time there is a certain nonchalance in the tone of the tantras discussion of death death is not a failure but is simply when quot ones life is exhausted quot and when the quot elements of ones body is consumed quot orofino 0 0 death is a perfectly inevitable natural occurrence the one occasion where death seems to be something that one should fear is when vajrasattva describes death as something quot sudden quot quot not forseen quot and quot unstoppable quot orofino 0 the implication is that death can hit us at any time and that we should be prepared nevertheless death also represents a rare opportunity for spiritual enlightenment according to tantric buddhist teachings on the intermediate states if we are able to recognize the clear light at death or the light found in the subsequent intermediate states as the projection of ones mind one attains instantaneous enlightenment in fact life and death are portrayed in the tantra of the great secret union of the sun and moon as rather similar phenomena both are natural occurrences over the course of time neither is privileged over the other both represent an opportunity to attain enlightenment and neither are inherently sacred or special both life and death go hand in hand life is an opportunity to prepare oneself for death and death is an opportunity to attain buddhahood in an efficient way life and death are not polarized to the extent that they are in our culture existence material existence an important polarization in the tantra of the great secret union of the sun and moon is the privileging of disembodied enlightened existence over material unenlightened existence though this type of polarization may seem unsurprising in a tradition where spiritual enlightenment and freedom are the ultimate goal it is particularly interesting that this polarization is also reflected on a textual level the imagery and metaphors of this text reflect this greater argument in the bardo of essential reality the individual receives a taste of what enlightenment could be like in this bardo one no longer has a physical body of flesh and blood but a quot body of light quot that quot is free of impurities and all visions manifest themselves in the dimension of happiness quot orofino 0 the link to the physical senses is severed and one only comes into contact with quot mental knowledge orofino 0 the visions that one sees are stunning one sees five coloured light that appears quot beyond material limits quot without inside or outside and quot subtle mobile trembling vibrant quivering scintillating quot orofino 0 furthermore the individual is not a passive observer she participates in the process when light from her heart joins with the light of the manifestations around her this is described as quot the union of the state of pure awareness with the light quot orofino 0 the images of light movement and the intangible suggest a certain spontaneity freedom and joy to enlightened reality in contrast to this the imagery in the bardo of existence is dominated by images that suggest a grimy trapped and painful existence as the individual moves from the previous bardo to the bardo of existence she loses the spiritual freedom and contentment of the former bardo instead she feels quot provoked quot by past desires and feels pressured into becoming quot involved quot 0 the visions that she sees suggest the gloomy din of industrial towns and cities she sees quot temples houses fire fog rain and the sounds of groups of people quot 0 quot damned quot to a rebirth she sees quot desert caves ruins precipices quot all of which represent the womb 0 thus the womb is not seen as a fertile symbol of life but a symbol of entrapment in the ceaseless cycle of rebirth in a series of evocative similes the tantra conveys the predicament that the individual finds herself in one feels the desire to move but feels held back by a net because one is blocked like straw that has taken fire or like being stuck in the mud one is like a bird in a trap that has been dug in the earth in the trap of desire without control that is transmigration 0 images like the net and the bird in a trap suggest the imprisonment of the individual in the cycle of transmigration while images like the quot mud quot and quot earth quot suggest the griminess of the samsaric condition finally the simile of the quot straw that has taken fire quot suggests the visceral immediacy of the pain found in cyclic existence therefore the tantra of the great secret union of the sun and moon reflects the privileging of disembodied enlightened existence over material unenlightened existence even on the level of metaphor and imagery the metaphor and imagery have the effect of acutely conveying a larger argument that privileges the freedom of enlightenment over the suffering of cyclic existence works cited orofino giacomella sacred teachings on death and liberation texts from the most ancient

10562555595 disgust your untrustworthy disgusting president by ken dilanian and janet stobart october 0 0 0 0 p m washington the white house and state department signed off on surveillance targeting phone conversations of friendly foreign leaders current and former u s intelligence officials said monday pushing back against assertions that president obama and his aides were unaware of the high level eavesdropping professional staff members at the national security agency and other u s intelligence agencies are angry these officials say believing the president has cast them adrift as he tries to distance himself from the disclosures by former nsa contractor edward snowden that have strained ties with close allies the resistance emerged as the white house said it would curtail foreign intelligence collection in some cases and two senior u s senators called for investigations of the practice france germany italy mexico and sweden have all publicly complained about the nsa surveillance operations which reportedly captured private cellphone conversations by german chancellor angela merkel among other foreign leaders on monday as spain joined the protest the fallout also spread to capitol hill until now members of congress have chiefly focused their attention on snowden 's disclosures about the nsa 's collection of u s telephone and email records under secret court orders quot with respect to nsa collection of intelligence on leaders of u s allies including france spain mexico and germany let me state unequivocally i am totally opposed quot said sen dianne feinstein d calif who chairs the senate intelligence committee quot unless the united states is engaged in hostilities against a country or there is an emergency need for this type of surveillance i do not believe the united states should be collecting phone calls or emails of friendly presidents and prime ministers quot she said in a statement feinstein said the intelligence committee had not been told of quot certain surveillance activities quot for more than a decade and she said she would initiate a major review of the nsa operation she added that the white house had informed her that quot collection on our allies will not continue quot although other officials said most u s surveillance overseas would not be affected sen john mccain r ariz ranking minority member of the armed services committee said congress should consider creating a special select committee to examine u s eavesdropping on foreign leaders quot obviously we 're going to want to know exactly what the president knew and when he knew it quot mccain told reporters in chicago quot we have always eavesdropped on people around the world but the advance of technology has given us enormous capabilities and i think you might make an argument that some of this capability has been very offensive both to us and to our allies quot in madrid spanish foreign ministry officials summoned the u s ambassador to object to the alleged nsa communications net in spain citing documents leaked by snowden el mundo a major spanish daily said the u s spy agency had collected data on more than 0 million phone calls made in just 0 days from early december 0 to early january 0 precisely how the surveillance is conducted is unclear but if a foreign leader is targeted for eavesdropping the relevant u s ambassador and the national security council staffer at the white house who deals with the country are given regular reports said two former senior intelligence officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in discussing classified information obama may not have been specifically briefed on nsa operations targeting a foreign leader 's cellphone or email communications one of the officials said quot but certainly the national security council and senior people across the intelligence community knew exactly what was going on and to suggest otherwise is ridiculous quot if u s spying on key foreign leaders was news to the white house current and former officials said then white house officials have not been reading their briefing books some u s intelligence officials said they were being blamed by the white house for conducting surveillance that was authorized under the law and utilized at the white house quot people are furious quot said a senior intelligence official who would not be identified discussing classified information quot this is officially the white house cutting off the intelligence community quot any decision to spy on friendly foreign leaders is made with input from the state department which considers the political risk the official said any useful intelligence is then given to the president 's counter terrorism advisor lisa monaco among other white house officials jay carney the white house press secretary said monday that obama had ordered a review of surveillance capabilities including those affecting america 's closest foreign partners and allies quot our review is looking across the board at our intelligence gathering to ensure that as we gather intelligence we are properly accounting for both the security of our citizens and our allies and the privacy concerns shared by americans and citizens around the world quot carney said caitlin hayden spokeswoman for the national security council said the review would examine quot whether we have the appropriate posture when it comes to heads of state how we coordinate with our closest allies and partners and what further guiding principles or constraints might be appropriate for our efforts quot she said the review should be completed this year citing documents from snowden the german news magazine der spiegel reported last week that the nsa 's special collection service had monitored merkel 's cellphone since 0 obama subsequently called merkel and told her he was not aware her phone had been hacked u s officials said intelligence officials also disputed a wall street journal article monday that said the white house had learned only this summer during a review of surveillance operations that might be exposed by snowden about an nsa program to monitor communications of 0

directed by terence fisher written by jimmy sangster peter bryan and edward percy peter cushing as doctor van helsing martina hunt as baroness meinster yvonne mauler as marianne danielle freda jackson as greta david peel as baron meinster the young and beautiful french schoolteacher marianne yvonne mauler is abandoned by her coach driver in an isolated village when she arrives at an inn seeking shelter she ignores the warnings of others and goes with baroness meinster martina hunt to stay with her at her castle there she meets the baroness handsome son baron meinster david peel who has his leg chained to a wall he tells her that his mother has taken his right to the lands and imprisoned him she steals the keys and sets him free and his mother and their servant greta freda jackon become terribly upset the baroness is bitten and killed by her evil son who we learn is a vampire when greta shows the body to marianne she runs away and is found by van helsing peter cushing the baron now free turns his mother into a vampire as well as a little later a pretty girl from the village meanwhile greta has become his human servant he sets his eyes on making marianne his as well and only van helsing can stop his reign of evil this is the first of hammers sequels to their classic influential and hugely successful the horror of dracula christopher lee does not return and there is no dracula nor is there any mention of him in the movie aside from the narration at the beginning which tells that he has many followers van helsing though does return making him the most direct link to the aforementioned film fisher finely directs the brides of dracula and it ranks as one of the most lush and sumptuous of all of the hammer films from the period the sets are beautiful as are the costumes worn by the cast the film is always stunning to look at a truly lavish production in every sense of the word despite the surely low budget there are some very exciting and memorable moments in the brides of dracula and even before cushing ever sets into a single frame there is already a wonderful set up one such moment is when the baroness talks about her son introducing him for the very first time its a great bit of dialogue and of acting from hunt and it really sets up the tone as well as the characters and story another potent and ultimately creepy scene comes when the pretty vamp is resurrected while greta cheers her on both the first confrontation between the baron and van helsing and the climax are very thrilling in fact the later is one of the finest of any and all of hammers movies and the ending is simply awesome and features one of the coolest ways to dispose of a vampire ever hunt isnt the only one who gives a great performance as the whole cast is just excellent cushing is his always amazing self proving yet again that he is the definitive van helsing he remains heroic and classy throughout the movie peel makes for a great villain so good that any disappointment over lee not appearing in the brides of dracula fade quickly there are few greater complements that can be paid to a horror star than that peels baron is sly seductive classy and outright evil mauler makes for a likeable and beautiful heroine in the movie and in keeping with the hammer tradition both of the vampire brides to the baron are very sexy and attractive as well the wonderful acting in this film is strengthened by great dialogue and the script is perhaps the best in all of vampire movie history this is an amazing film that has rightfully taken its place as one of hammers very best films and well lives up to its legacy no list of the best of hammers work is complete without including the brides of dracula and no true fan of bloodsucker cinema should miss it

freda jackson laying with her ear to the mound muttering into the freshly turned earth yes my dear i know its dark no i cant help youve got to push the scene has a really macabre intensity and the unmistakable allusions to childbirth play out perfectly with freda already established as having nursed the young baron from infancy playing the part of an encouraging midwife as the innkeepers

12533147084 excitement mighty joe young 0 half sheet 0 '' x0 '' mighty joe young 0 youtu be yskrs0avy 0 t 0s trailer it could be said that this film represents a changing of the guard for most of the first half of the 0th century if you talked about stop motion animation you were basically talking about willis obrien obrien wasnt the only one using the technique of course but the most famous of the old movies employing it were his work obrien was the man behind king kong the son of kong and the 0 version of the lost world and for that matter he also worked on the latter films 0 remake along with several other mostly forgotten movies going all the way back to 0 but while obrien would continue to work in the special effects field throughout the 0s he had by that time been eclipsed by a new alpha male in the stop motion pack the legendary ray harryhausen what gives mighty joe young significance all out of proportion to its overall merits is the fact that it is the only movie on which both obrien and harryhausen collaborated on the effects work mighty joe young is also the final installment in what might loosely be called the rko monkey trilogy the three films about oversized gorillas directed by ernest b schoedsack and produced by merian c cooper the previous two films were of course king kong and the son of kong and while it is by no means up to the standard set by the original kong it is at least vastly superior to that movies embarrassing cheap jack sequel in the simplest terms this is a fable about a girl and her pet gorilla and as with all fables you can rest assured that there will be a moral involved at some point our story begins in africa where six or seven year old jill young lora lee michel for the moment but for most of the movie shell be played by terry moore who came from son of lassie and who after some 0 years of respectability would be reduced to black eliminator and hellhole gets it into her head one day to trade a few of her toys and her fathers heavy duty flashlight the kind cops use to beat you up with for a baby gorilla that a pair of local hunters have captured her plantation owner father regis toomey from one frightened night and voyage to the bottom of the sea i hasten to add knows nothing of this transaction until he arrives home from wherever it is that white plantation owners in sub saharan africa go during the day and finds said gorilla in jills bed as he says to jill when she asks if hes mad at her he takes the situation rather well for a man who has learned that his daughter has just acquired a pet ape but that does not mean jill is allowed to keep the beast a father has to draw the line somewhere right it appears however that mr young ought to have used something more along the lines of those huge smelly markers the kids use to tag the stalls of public toilets to accomplish his line drawing because the very next shot has jill feeding her gorilla whom she has named joe from a baby bottle while her father looks on bemusedly feebly trying to reassert his authority to keep his home free from 0 pound apes but it does no good of course and when the screen fills with the image of the brooklyn bridge and the legend new york 0 years later we know without having to be told that jill still has her unorthodox pet so what are we doing on the opposite side of the atlantic from jill her father and joe why were looking in on the activities of a certain nightclub proprietor by the name of max ohara robert armstrong from king kong and its sequel ohara has just decided to spread his wings a bit and open a new club on the west coast in hollywood to be exact because of the inherently risky nature of this venture he wants to make sure that he makes a strong initial showing and he has come up with what he regards as a fool proof angle for the new night spot riding the wave of public fascination with exotic locales that was then giving rise to the tiki bar ohara plans to give his l a club an african theme and to that end he has arranged to go on a safari for the purposes of capturing live african animals to give the whole affair the strongest possible air of authenticity obviously one does not attempt to do such a thing alone and ohara hires an oklahoma cowboy named gregg ben johnson who after a long and presumably rewarding career making westerns ended up providing low cost name recognition to such films as the deadly bees the town that dreaded sundown and cherry 0 along with all of his oklahoma cowboy buddies to conduct the actual capture of the necessary beasts who would ever have thought that you could rope a lion the way you do a steer but thats just what gregg and his men do until they find themselves fact to face with an altogether more challenging quarry a huge stop motion gorilla the fact that this is a stop motion gorilla should tell you a thing or two as should the exclamation on the part of oharas safari guide that gorilla territory is hundreds of miles away our expectations are confirmed a few minutes later when a young woman appears and orders the gorilla who had been winning the struggle against the cowboys hands down to cease and desist the woman the now grown up jill young then launches into gregg ohara and the cowboys demanding to know what in the hell they think theyre doing trespassing on her land and attacking her pet ape ohara and his associates understandably flummoxed have no answer capable of satisfying jill and they are left standing around looking like fools when the girl storms off into the bush with her gorilla but ohara is not a man to remain stymied for long and it soon crosses his mind that jill and joe are exactly what his l a nightclub needs to make the sort of splash ohara seeks he sends gregg to the young family plantation which jill has been running by herself since the death of her father some six months before to apologize for the misunderstanding and to try to get her interested in listening to oharas pitch gregg succeeds and ohara springs into action he promises her fame fortune excitement a swank new wardrobe pretty much everything that a certain other robert armstrong character once promised a similar nave young woman in fact and like that other woman jill falls for it hook line and sinker within days she joe and gregg are in l a working for ohara the new club is just as garish and tacky and hideous as you might imagine all caged lions bamboo walls and african masks and then theres the floor show which features black dancers dressed as african tribal warriors and musicians playing traditional african rhythm instruments but the main attraction of course is mr joseph young of africa the gorilla makes his big entrance after an introductory speech from ohara rising from a pit in the center of the stage to hold aloft a grand piano on which jill plays beautiful dreamer the song to which she used to put him to sleep as an infant oharas crowd is duly impressed and the promoter assures jill that her contract will be good for a long long time of course thats pretty much the exact opposite of what jill wanted to hear it doesnt take long before the novelty of being a novelty act wears thin for her and it wears thin for joe even faster the fact that ohara has jill and her gorilla perform ever more exploitative and demeaning acts as the weeks wear on tenth mammoth week the sign on the front of the club trumpets doesnt exactly help the situation either and it is during the tenth mammoth week that jill goes to her employer with gregg along for moral support to announce that she and joe are going back to africa ohara is predictably dismayed but he acquiesces on the condition that jill allow him some time to find a replacement act that seems fair enough to jill but seven weeks later 0th colossal week theres no sign of any replacement and jill is fed up the show that night is particularly unsavory involving the audience getting to throw enormous coins at the stage for joe to try to catch in a commensurately enormous cup and it gets out of hand when one drunk patron decides it would be funny to throw a bottle at the ape instead jill immediately stops the show returns joe to his cage in the basement and goes to talk to ohara again meanwhile the offending drunk and his friends sneak downstairs to ply joe with wine i guess it seemed funny at the time but the three men stop laughing when the inebriated joe smashes out of his cage and destroys the club relenting only when jill ohara and gregg arrive to bring him under control of course the police arrive too and they take a rather dim view of rampaging apes so for that matter does the city of los angeles which secures a court order for joes destruction faced with such an incredibly ugly situation and with the certain knowledge that its all his fault ohara goes to jill with a plan to sneak her and joe back home to africa the rest of the film sees this plan put into action with an array of blunders and strokes of bad luck to add some suspense and concludes by giving joe an unexpected opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of the law basically what weve got here is an old fashioned family movie its fundamentally escapist and unthreatening but its not so cloyingly juvenile as to be unendurable for an adult audience and because it was made in the late 0s a time when adults were still willing to credit children with a certain amount of resilience in the face of tragedy before suitable for children was taken to mean unrelentingly mindlessly upbeat there is up until the very end a legitimate question regarding how it will all turn out when movies like this are made today a happy ending is a foregone conclusion here though there is no such easy assurance even if everything working out in the end seems to be the likeliest outcome this genuine uncertainty is mighty joe youngs greatest strength and makes it easier to look beyond its essential silliness and sappiness to find a surprisingly good if childish film

13699340714 awe saint peter 's place st peter 's square italian piazza san pietro latin forum sancti petri pronounced piaa san pito is a massive plaza located directly in front of st peter 's basilica in the vatican city the papal enclave surrounded by rome directly west of the neighbourhood or rione of borgo at the centre of the square is a four thousand year old egyptian obelisk erected at the current site in 0 gian lorenzo bernini designed the square almost 0 years later including the massive tuscan colonnades four columns deep which embrace visitors in quot the maternal arms of mother church quot a granite fountain constructed by bernini in 0 matches another fountain designed by carlo maderno dating to 0 the open space which lies before the basilica was redesigned by gian lorenzo bernini from 0 to 0 under the direction of pope alexander vii as an appropriate forecourt designed quot so that the greatest number of people could see the pope give his blessing either from the middle of the faade of the church or from a window in the vatican palace quot norwich 0 p 0 bernini had been working on the interior of st peter 's for decades now he gave order to the space with his renowned colonnades using the tuscan form of doric the simplest order in the classical vocabulary not to compete with the palace like faade by carlo maderno but he employed it on an unprecedented colossal scale to suit the space and evoke a sense of awe there were many constraints from existing structures the massed accretions of the vatican palace crowded the space to the right of the basilica 's faade the structures needed to be masked without obscuring the papal apartments the obelisk marked a centre and a granite fountain by carlo maderno stood to one side bernini made the fountain appear to be one of the foci of the ovato tondo embraced by his colonnades and eventually matched it on the other side in 0 just five years before his death the trapezoidal shape of the piazza which creates a heightened perspective for a visitor leaving the basilica and has been praised as a masterstroke of baroque theater is largely a product of site constraint

13725456985 fear photo 0 through dreams we can seek a fantasy world beyond our imagination but what happens when problems in your real life become absorbed into your subconscious and disturb your flights of the imagination over the years ive developed a profound interest in sigmund freud an influential psychologist of the early 0th century a lot of freuds work dealt with dream interpretations and how problems within our daily life affect the meanings of our dreams through my concentration im exploring the idea that our external conflicts do appear in our dreams and im using myself as the subject throughout my series i explored my dreams in a soft palette of black and white and color i decided to do this in order to create a separation of the dream world and reality while in the dream world images 0 0 i shot my photographs in black and white in my final three pictures images 0 0 there is a transformation into color with a gradual increase in brightness and saturation as im waking up from my dream my reasoning for this was also for the viewer to gain a sense of realization although my series has both black and white and color each photograph is shot in high contrast studio lighting images 0 0 are representative of the death of innocence not an actual suicide this was to create an intense urgency throughout the dream world but to make the viewer question whether it was actually me dying or a certain part of me while i used high contrast i also used my light sources to emphasize things i wanted the viewers to see i wanted to emphasize things like the models in images 0 0 that played the role of representing sexuality fears thinking with your heart or with your head as shadows hands bodies i also incorporated reoccurring objects such as the rope and the sheets throughout my series to weave a sense of mystery throughout the series

13813965804 fear fear this emotion can influence decision making since it 's a basically feeling produced by a present and imminent danger which is closely linked to the stimulus that generates leading the person to experience a sense of a tendency to avoidant action which does not allow it to meet its responsibilities nor ever be able to take specific and reasonable decisions pessimistic judgments of future events an example evidenced in the organization where i am doing my internship is the fear that several employees will have to one of the executives that compose the senior management this feeling of fear is due in large part to past experiences with other employees because when he requires any employee is because something bad has happened so it leads to their calls they perceive as an imminent danger in relation to their job

island brooklyn new york this unique sea dwelling rabbit which is actually a close relative of the sea lion was officially discovered and investigated by henry hudson when he first visited this land to colonize the area by order of the dutch government it was named new amsterdam todays new york city this island was named after he saw the beach covered with strange swimming wild rabbits the word coney island means wild rabbit island in dutch originally conyne eylandt or konijneneiland in modern dutch spelling sea rabbits were also referred mermaid rabbit merrabbit rabbit fish or seal rabbit in the natural history documents in the 0th century the current conservation status or risk of extinction of the sea rabbit is extinct in the wild this website features two species of sea rabbits which have been taken care of by dr takeshi yamada at the coney island sea rabbit repopulation center which is a part of the marine biology department of the coney island university in brooklyn new york they are coney island sea rabbit monafluffchus americanus called seara and coney island tiger striped sea rabbit monafluffchus konjinicus called stripes the photographs and videos featured in this website chronicle adventures of the coney island sea rabbits and the world as seen by them this article also documented efforts of dr takeshi yamada for bringing back the nearly extinct sea rabbits to coney island in the city of new york and beyond dr yamada produced a series of public lectures workshops original public live interactive fine art performances and fine art exhibitions about sea rabbits at a variety of occasions and institutions in the city of new york and beyond dr yamada is an internationally active educator book author wildlife conservationist and high profile artist who lives and works in brooklyn new york sea rabbit other common names coney island sea rabbit beach rabbit seal rabbit mer rabbit merrabbit atlantic sea rabbit latin name monafluffchus americanus origin atlantic coast of the united states description of the specimen in the early 0th centurys european fur craze drove the fleet of dutch ships to the eastern costal area of america then holland was the center of the world just like the italy was in the previous century new york city was once called new amsterdam when dutch merchants landed and established colonies among them henry hudson is probably the most recognized individual in the history of new york city today this small island is inhabited by two major creatures which we do not have in our homeland the one creature is a large arthropod made of three body segments the frontal segment resembles a horseshoe the middle segment resembles a spiny crab and its tail resembles a sharp sword although they gather beaches here in great numbers they are not edible due to their extremely offensive odor another creature which is abundant here has the head of wild rabbit this animal of great swimming ability has frontal legs resemble the webbed feet of a duck the bottom half of the body resembles that of a seal this docile rabbit of the sea is easy to catch as it does not fear people the larger male sea rabbits control harems of 0 to 0 females the meat of the sea rabbit is very tender and tasty this is what hadson wrote in his personal journal in 0 about the horseshoe crab and the sea rabbit in todays coney island area of brooklyn new york sadly just like the dodo bird and the thylacine the sea rabbit was driven to extinction by the european settlers greed when dutch merchants and traders arrived here sea rabbits were one of the first animals they hunted down to bring their furs to homeland to satisfy the fur craze of the time to increase the shipment volume of furs of sea rabbit and beavers from new amsterdam dutch merchants also started using wampum beads made of special clam shells as the first official currency of this country at the north eastern shores of the united states two species of sea rabbits were commonly found they are coney island sea rabbit monafluffchus americanus and coney island tiger striped sea rabbit monafluffchus konjinicus sadly due to their over harvesting in the previous centuries their conservation status became extinct in the wild et in the red list endangered species by the international union for conservation of nature iucn currently these sea rabbits are only found at breeding centers at selected zoos and universities such as coney island aquarium and coney island university in brooklyn new york the one shown in this photograph was named quot seara quot and has been cared by dr takeshi yamada at coney island university the sea rabbit is one of the families of the pinniped order pinnipeds from latin penna flat and pes pedis foot are sea mammals they are homeothermic i e having high and regulated inner temperature lung breathing i e dependant on atmospheric oxygen animals having come back to semi aquatic life as soon as they arrive ashore

pups with a dark brown fur as soon as birth occurs the mothers special smell and calls help her pups bond specifically to her the mother stays ashore with her pup for about one week during which the pup gains weight during the first week spent with her newborn the mother becomes receptive she will be impregnated by the bull which control the harem implantation of the embryo will occur 0 months later in march april during the reproductive period the best males copulate with several tens females to do so males have to stay ashore without feeding in order to keep their territory and their harem in mid january when the last females have been fecundated males leave at sea to feed some of them will come back later in march april for the moult the other ones will stay at sea and will come back on coney island only in next november after fecundation the mother goes at sea for her first meal at sea mothers feed on clams crabs shrimps fish herring anchovy pollock capelin etc and squids when she is back the mother recovers her pups at the beach she left them suckling occurs after auditive and olfactory recognition had occured in march april the dark brown fur is totally replaced by an adult like light brownish grey fur during the moult that lasts 0 0 months this new fur is composed by 0 layers externally the guard fur is composed by flat hairs that recover themselves when wet by doing so they make a water proof barrier for the under fur the underfur retains air when the seal is dry because of isolating properties of the air the underfur is the insulating system of the fur in march april the fur of adults is partially replaced first reproduction occurs at 0 yr old in females males are physiologically matures at 0 year old but socially matures at 0 years old note the name

holland was the center of the world just like the italy was in the previous century new york city was once called new amsterdam when dutch merchants landed and established colonies among them henry hudson is probably the most recognized individual in the history of new york city today this small island is inhabited by two major creatures which we do not have in our homeland the one creature is a large arthropod made of three body segments the frontal segment resembles a horseshoe the middle segment resembles a spiny crab and its tail resembles a sharp sword although they gather beaches here in great numbers they are not edible due to their extremely offensive odor another creature which is abundant here has the head of wild rabbit this animal of great swimming ability has frontal legs resemble the webbed feet of a duck the bottom half of the body resembles that of a seal this docile rabbit of the sea is easy to catch as it does not fear people the larger male sea rabbits control harems of 0 to 0 females the meat of the sea rabbit is very tender and tasty this is what hadson wrote in his personal journal in 0 about the horseshoe crab and the sea rabbit in todays coney island area of brooklyn new york sadly just like the dodo bird and the thylacine the sea rabbit was driven to extinction by the european settlers greed when dutch merchants and traders arrived here sea rabbits were one of the first animals they hunted down to bring their furs to homeland to satisfy the fur craze of the time to increase the shipment volume of furs of sea rabbit and beavers from new amsterdam dutch merchants also started using wampum beads made of special clam shells as the first official currency of this country at the north eastern shores of the united states two species of sea rabbits were commonly found they are coney island sea rabbit monafluffchus americanus and coney island tiger striped sea rabbit monafluffchus konjinicus sadly due to their over harvesting in the previous centuries their conservation status became extinct in the wild et in the red list endangered species by the international union for conservation of nature iucn currently these sea rabbits are

14197256617 sadness vision of us nr 0 tenderloin san francisco ca social work in the tenderloin will kill something inside of you www vice com read social work in the tenderloin will kill the tenderloin is widely acknowledged as the most hellish neighborhood in san francisco out of the city 's ten most violent crime plots the tenderloin is home to seven recent stats estimate the neighborhood has an average of three major crimes per hour including one third of the citys drug offenses with a yearly mean of two crimes per resident the population is made up of more than 0 homeless people and contains one fourth of the citys hiv positive drug users filthy sidewalks and vacant buildings peppered with single occupancy hotel rooms provide a home to all levels of drugs and prostitution my friend jenny has been employed as a social worker in the tenderloin for several years now her tweets about it things like today 0 dead clients 0 murdered provider 0 client defecated in the lobby 0 dead dog amp 0 facebook friend posted pictures of nachos got me curious as to what her job is like she was kind enough to answer some of my questions vice i imagine it varies greatly but can you describe your average workday jenny the first thing is getting through the door at 0 am we usually have to step over clients or random strangers passed out on the benches from drinking and or using since god knows when the smell is the first thing that hits youa stench of urine feces poor hygieneit 's really at its strongest in the morning but you get used to it throughout the day then we check our voicemail twenty messages from the same two or three clients who either scream their financial requests over and over simply sit there and breathe or tell you that witches are under their beds waiting for the next blood sacrifice paranoid clients like to fixate on witches satan etc anyway we get ready to open and hand out checks to the clients who are either on daily budgets or who make random check requests the budgeted clients are the most low functioning as they can be restricted to as little as 0 per day in order to curb their harm reduction they 'll go and spend that 0 on whatever piece of crack they can find and then two hours later they 're back begging for more money clients will find some really brilliant ways to beg when we 're not dealing with clients out in the lobby which can involve anything from handing out checks to cleaning up blood to clearing the floor for folks having seizures we 're usually dealing with the government agency assholes over at social security i personally work with around 0 clients so the paperwork and filing can be extraordinary my average day starts at 0 am and lasts until 0 or 0 pm you 're in the tenderloin right what 's the deal with that area yeah the tenderloin is where the majority of our clients live in residential hotels sros it 's one of the two predominately black neighborhoods left in sf the other is the western addition and it 's the center of the crack heroin and oxy drug culture and it hosts the transgendered sex worker scene it 's an incredible neighborhood there 's a preservation society that works really hard to keep the original buildings in place so the 'loin has an impressive architectural history not to mention random shit like vintage fetish magazine stores pot dispensaries and transgender strip clubs it 's literally located at the bottom of a giant hill nob hill where the old money sits and looks down on the poor black folk so the geography of sf 's class structure is more blatant than in other cities i think it 's a fucked place human shit smeared on the sidewalks tweakers sitting on the corner dismantling doorknobs for hours heroin users nodding out in the middle of the streets drug dealers paying cornerstore owners 0 to sell in their stores dudes pissing on your doorstep as you leave for work etc it 's a weird fascinating and very hard place to live why do you think so many of your clients are paranoid and or disturbed why are my clients so fucked up traumatic backgrounds ptsd and severe mental illness schizophrenia bipolar disorder and dementia are the most frequent cases we see and whenever you combine a drug habit with compromised mental health you usually get a mess of a brain abuse rape murder suicide waryou name it they 've experienced it most of our clients live with on site case management and nursing staff so their medication is monitored but when they stop taking the meds that 's when psychotic breaks and fixations happen i 've been the subject of quite a few of these fixations and even though our agency pushes the belief that housing is healthcare the shit that goes down inside these residential hotels can be hard to stomach a lot of our clients feel safer living on the streets how does being in the midst of so much mental illness affect you emotionally man social work is so fucking weird people think you 're a saint it takes a certain person to do that kind of work is what i hear a lot fuck that when you 're young you can afford to have ideals and believe in stuff and think that what you 're doing matters but after watching grown men shit themselves and sometimes try to eat their own shit not to mention the countless number of times i 've had to pick people off the floor and put them back in their wheelchairs because they 've been drinking since 0 am and ca n't even sit up straight your measly 0k salary starts to matter a helluva lot more than social justice i think i got into social work because i had this idea of it somehow killing my ego it seems silly but it felt very real at the time there 's a sadness to watching your idealism and convictions go to shit not to mention that working in such a thankless and fucked system will kill a sacred part of you i feel tired for the most part people do not want help they want money or they want drugs or they want death what you do seems important though there must be some goodness in it too right i feel like you tweet sometimes about people bringing you weird things they see as gifts or saying nice if totally bizarre things are there moments that help balance the heavy i do n't really think of what i do as important because days are days and everyone is dying and who am i to think anything of anything but yes there are moments there is goodness today a client brought me a huge drawing he made of a tree in golden gate park it must 've taken him hours he said he drew every leaf i told him the line work was amazing and he said an amazing tree for an amazing woman and then he asked me when is the fourth of july sometimes moments like that are enough blakebutler

14260886083 contentment bock final series for my final series i simply wanted to create a set of visually appealing photos in doing this i wanted to explore the extreme contentness one feels when looking at something organized and appealing personally i really enjoy seeing things that are organized yet random where the organization and color are the only things that relate the objects i wanted to incorporate this into my series to show that even though the objects are completely different from each other they can still come together to form something visually appealing each photo is organized by color and the colors are yellow blue red green and orange some of them turned out better than the others but they all give off the feeling of precision contentment and organization they all are appealing individually and still look nice together as a group even though they are all completely different objects they still relate to each other because of their color and the way they are organized i believe the yellow picture demonstrates my concept the most clearly because of the variety in shades of yellow as well as the variety of objects that come together and make it visually appealing to the viewer even though other colors are present the image still goes together and creates the content feeling i also think the blue image does a nice job of showing this in that the objects are very random ranging from a sock to a candle to a whale cookie cutter yet they still all come together and create something that is appealing to the viewer the images as a whole really go together nicely even though each one involves a different color i tried to keep some parts of the images similar and this involved using some of the same objects in different colors this helped even more to tie in the aspect of all the images relating to each other
14261390794 awe the colonnade of amenhotep iii on the background luxor temple the colonnade in the luxor temple in luxor egypt built by amenhotep iii of the new kingdom 's 0th dynasty to be the grand entrance to the temple of amen of the opet is one of the most impressive elements in any egyptian monument it represents the third stage in that king 's elaborate building plans at luxor temple and though it chronologically precedes the great court it follows that element geographically indeed this one hundred meter long colonnade is a part of the oldest segment of this temple these fourteen great columns in two rows erected during amenhotep iii 's reign though only completed after his death may have originally been intended as the main axis of what was to become a great hypostyle hall similar to the one at karnak however if that is true it was never finished the colonnade was finished during the reign of tutankhamun ay and horemheb the axis of this colonnade as well as the chambers south of it is clearly different than the later ramesside additions that precede it in the temple we believe that the change was made after ramesses ii decided to physically connect luxor temple by a causeway with the temple of khonsu at karnak which had a different axial alignment the columns which stand 0 meters high have open papyrus capitals that support a roof 0 meters above the ground they are surmounted by abacus which in turn support architrave blocks the space is narrow being only ten meters wide originally it had walls that rose to the full height of the roof with only small clerestory windows cut at the ceiling level to allow in sunlight however it is difficult today to appreciate just how impressive this chamber must have been because the walls now only rise some a few meters high yet to have walked into this dark and forbidding colonnade during ancient times passing from the open brightly lit courtyard must have been awe inspiring touregypt net

global research june 0 0 world socialist web site region middle east amp north africa usa theme 0 amp 'war on terrorism ' media disinformation in depth report iraq report media indoctrination a column written by chelsea bradley manning from his cell in the military prison at fort leavenworth kansas has done more to illuminate the real sources of the present debacle for us imperialism in iraq than all of the lying and self serving pieces produced by the well paid pundits of the new york times the washington post and the other major news outlets combined the column by the imprisoned us soldier published in sundays new york times is directed at exposing the role of government secrecy and control of the media in foisting onto the american public a war of aggression launched on the basis lies manning insists that the sudden collapse of the us trained and funded iraqi army and the descent of the country toward a full blown sectarian civil war only demonstrate that the concerns that motivated him to pass some 0 secret documents on the iraq and afghanistan wars as well as us foreign policy skullduggery around the globe to wikileaks have not been resolved breaking the wall of secrecy and misinformation maintained by the government and the media provoked the wrath of the us ruling establishment the soldier and former intelligence analyst is now serving a 0 year prison term in april an army general rejected a motion for clemency manning examines the us reaction to the 0 election of prime minister nouri al maliki who had been installed by the us occupation four years earlier the american press the imprisoned soldier recalls was flooded with stories declaring the elections a success aimed at creating the image of the us war having succeeded in creating a stable and democratic iraq during this same period he writes he and other military analysts in baghdad were receiving continuous reports of a brutal crackdown of political dissidents by iraqs ministry of the interior and federal police acting on behalf of maliki opponents of the us backed prime minister were often tortured or even killed he notes manning exposes the direct complicity of the us military in these crimes reporting that he informed the us officer in command of eastern baghdad that 0 individuals arrested for publishing a critique of malikis government had absolutely no ties to terrorism the commander responded that he didnt need this information instead i should assist the federal police in locating more anti iraqi print shops i was shocked by our militarys complicity in the corruption of that election yet these deeply troubling details flew under the american medias radar he writes this account gives the lie to the us media chorus that the present debacle in iraq is all malikis fault manning attributes the sharp divergence between the developments in iraq and the medias portrayal of them in part to the pentagons censorship of coverage of the war through the system of embedded journalists reporters who had good relations with the military and provided favorable coverage got access while those who exposed scandals crimes and lies faced blacklisting he writes there is no doubt that this system of military censorship played a major role in concealing from the american people the grisly and criminal character of a war that claimed the lives of upward of a million iraqis while killing nearly 0 us troops and leaving tens of thousands more wounded however the process of embedding began well before bush ordered shock and awe to be unleashed on baghdad and included not just war correspondents but the top columnists editors and publishers of the major newspapers and other media outlets people like times publisher arthur ochs sulzberger jr and bill keller who in 0 rose from senior writer and leading war advocate to times executive editor lent themselves and their newspapers unreservedly to a massive campaign to pressure the american public to support a war of aggression against iraq they decided to parrot the governments lies about iraqi weapons of mass destruction and ties between baghdad and al qaedaboth non existentand to eschew any critical investigation of the bush administrations war propaganda on the contrary through the sinister efforts of the times and its correspondent judith miller they embellished upon this propaganda piling on their own lies now as the full extent of the debacle created by the wanton destruction of iraqi society is revealed those who served as media propagandists for the war are circling the wagons looking to protect their own backsides columnists like the times thomas friedmanwho more than a decade ago wrote that he had no problem with a war for oiland nicholas kristof have published pieces insisting that maliki is solely to blame for iraqs disintegration and the us had nothing to do with it they were followed monday by a particularly foul column by times columnist roger cohen entitled take mosul back calling for us intervention to drive back the fanatics of the isis islamic state of iraq and syria cohen uses the column to ridicule those playing the blame game a breathtakingly cynical denunciation of any attempt to assign responsibility for a war that killed over a million people and destroyed an entire society the facts are plain enough he writes the united states invaded iraq in 0 because of its weapons of mass destruction however iraq did not have any weapons of mass destruction plain enough indeedthe war was based upon a lie which cohen helped disseminate he goes on there was no al qaeda in saddams iraq the united states birthed it through the invasion thus another lie was used to justify the war whose catastrophic consequences include the strengthening of extreme islamist and sectarian tendencies in iraq and throughout the region in his piece cohen demands that the obama administration unleash targeted military force against the fanatics of isis but he enthusiastically supported washingtons use of these same fanatics in wars for regime change first in libya and then syria he waves aside any questions about the logic of such policies a logical approach in the middle east is seldom a feasible approach the only logic is the use of whatever instrument is at hand to assert us hegemony and plunder the regions resources the blame game misses the point cohen repeats both iraq and syria were ripe for dismemberment before americas hapless intervention whom is he kidding the us intervention was anything but hapless employing all of the firepower at the pentagons command in a campaign that saw some 0 bombing sortiesincluding 0 using cruise missilesin the space of three days one might just as well describe 0 europe as ripe for dismemberment and hitlers blitzkrieg as hapless or dismiss the nuremberg tribunals as a futile exercise in the blame game the reality is that real apportioning of blame has yet to take place that requires that those responsible for planning and executing the war of aggression against iraqfrom bush cheney rumsfeld rice and powell to the top military commandersbe placed on trial as war criminals at nuremberg it bears recalling standing in the dockand ultimately on the gallowswith the surviving leaders of the third reich was julius streicher the editor of the vile anti semitic weekly der strmer and later the dailyfrnkische tageszeitung while the tribunal found that streicher had no direct part in formulating war policy he nonetheless played a vital role in poisoning the consciousness of the german people without streichers propaganda efforts the prosecution argued the german generals would have had no one to follow orders in any genuine accounting for the crimes of the iraq war cohen friedman keller and those like them who enthusiastically served the pentagons propaganda machine would have to similarly be tried for their criminal promotion of aggressive war

14504622806 awe the three peaks dolomites the dolomites are located in northern italy the mountain range represented the front line during the first world war which was where the italians faced off against the austro hungarian empire when you walk though the mountain range it seems incredible that such a breathtakingly beautiful place could have been used as a horrible theatre of killing and death but there are traces everywhere especially near mount lagazuoi the vie ferrate metal cables and ladders attached to the mountains are everywhere and allow climbers to soar above most of the local peaks they were originally constructed to allow soldiers to get around with having as much cover as possible the alta vie walks themselves were constructed during the great war and they allowed supplies to be brought from the foothills up to the check points and sniper points you can walk past a boulder which is as big as a building and realise that it was completely hollowed out from the inside and used as a sniper look out not forgetting its dark history i think that the best way of describing the dolomites is as the hidden gem of mountain ranges in europe what an amazing place for the nurturing of the creative imagination while doing this trek i was always waiting for a group of hobbits and a wizard to come walking around the corner every where you walked in the dolomites you were confronted by weird and wonderful rock formations this view looks back towards the famous three peaks lavaredo rock formations i originally got the idea to do a trek in the dolomites after seeing a post card of lavaredo on my friends wall she is an ultra runner and informed me that she gone for a race which passed by these amazing looking rock formations i remember seeing the jagged teeth jutting out into the sky and finding it amazing that such a miracle of nature was only a short plane ride away so myself and my wife added on a trek around the three peaks to our main trek the alta via 0 it was completely worth the effort as we were awestruck walking the wonderful rock formations i actually took the photo on top of a summit during the alta via 0 and was surprised to get such a fantastic view back towards lavaredo it was wonderful to get such an all encompassing view as we had trekked around it only a few days previously

14780564039 awe ascension of christ into heaven detail st peter and st paul east harling norfolk with its aisles clerestory porch and chancel st peter and st paul is a textbook example of its century although there are a number of curiosities that add even more interest the vestry on the north side of the chancel for example which was once a shrine chapel retains its image niche on its eastern face and there are more image niches these with elaborate foliage pedestals in the buttresses of the tower everything is topped off by a lead and timber fleche which was apparently the model for the one at st peter mancroft in norwich a church which has several features in common with this one the tower is a delight the buttressing and pinnacles exactly in proportion to make it appear to rise like a fairy castle from the ground the south porch by contrast is despite its flushwork rather austere a result of its rebuilding early in the 0th century before the ecclesiological movement took hold all in all this is as good as 0th century rebuilding gets the money coming thanks to anne harling having no less than three husbands who all wanted to spend as little time in purgatory as possible you step down into a wide space which on a dull day can be rather gloomy although inevitably heavily restored by the victorians st peter and st paul does not have that depressingly anonymous urban feel you so often find in churches of this size this is partly because the beautiful parclose screen in the south aisle partitions off so much space creating a sense of rooms within rooms altering the way your eyes are inevitably drawn to the east the rood screen must have been vast here its dado survives at the west end a deeply traceried affair with its features presented in carving rather than painting when the rood screen was in its proper place to move from the nave into the chancel must have been like stepping from darkness into light this is because of the feature that makes east harling famous the vast east window with its 0th century glass after st peter mancroft it is the best collection in norfolk unusually the provenance of the glass is fairly well documented we can be fairly certain that it came from this church originally still present after the reformation it was removed by the harling family to the hall in the early 0th century they may have been laudians wanting to preserve it from the intentions of the puritans or merely thought it would look nice in their dining hall whatever we know that shortly before francis blomefield visited here in the 0s it was returned to the church and set in its present configuration in 0 when war threatened it was removed again being reset just before cautley visited in the early 0s there are parts of at least three sequences here two of which were almost certainly in the east window originally and one which almost certainly wasn't essentially the window contains two rosary sequences the joyful mysteries of the blessed virgin which include the annunciation the nativity and the assumption and the sorrowful mysteries of the blessed virgin which include the crucifixion and the deposition however this is open to interpretation as we shall see there is also the figure of st mary magdalene which may once have been associated with a nave altar and would have been located in a window there the five lights contain four rows of panels making twenty altogether top row i annunciation mary at her prayer desk gabriel crowned and haloed with a sceptre of lilies kneels in supplication ii visitation elizabeth hooded to show her age places her hand on mary 's pregnant belly iii nativity two midwives look on the infant in the manger is rayed a horned cow gazes in awe iv adoration of the shepherds one holds a lamb one plays pipes a third appears to offer a fleece v adoration of the magi two of the wise men gauge each others ' reactions as the third offers his gift second row vi collection of fragments vii presentation in the temple joseph carries the doves mary offers the child to simeon anna is not shown viii the finding in the temple head covered mary bursts in among the men to find her son teaching ix the wedding at canaa christ seated at the top table blesses a chicken and a ham mary directs the servant x collection of fragments third row xi mary of magdala mary holds her long hair ready to anoint christ 's feet probably not from this window originally xii the betrayal at gethsemane judas kisses christ peter cuts off the ear of the high priest 's servant xiii crucifixion mary swoons in john 's arms xiv deposition from the cross the pieta tears spring from mary 's eyes xv assumption of the blessed virgin mary is assumed bodily into heaven bottom row xvi donor probably robert wingfield second husband of anne harling xvii resurrection christ steps fully clothed from the tomb unusually the soldiers are awake xviii ascension of christ mary surrounded by disciples watches as her son ascends to heaven xix descent of the holy spirit mary surrounded by disciples receives the holy spirit at pentecost xx donor probably william chamberlain first husband of anne harling nowadays we tend to think of the rosary as consisting of three sequences of five mysteries each but in the late middle ages things were much more flexible and rosary sequences often consisted of seven mysteries the glorious mysteries sequence of which the assumption is now a part is a later development and the two adorations shown here are subsumed into a single mystery there are a couple of images here that do n't quite fit the wedding at canaa is obviously a marian text and yet is not traditionally a rosary subject similarly the betrayal the only one of the images not to feature mary i wonder if what we have here are parts of two separate sequences a marian sequence of mysteries i v vii ix xv and a passion sequence xii xiv xvii xix they are both clearly the work of the same workshop and mary is always shown with the same face and dress but this would not preclude them from being two sequences why were they here at all we need to get away from thinking of such things as a 'poor man 's bible ' the need for which was superseded at the reformation these were devotional objects designed to be used as meditations while praying and saying the rosary they were created in the 0th century a time when the mind of the church was fiercely concentrated on asserting orthodox catholic doctrine in the face of local superstitions and abuses as such they were anathema to the reformers and were later elsewhere destroyed for being superstitious not for being superfluous an 0th century antiquarian mind ignorant of the nature of catholic devotion might easily mix the two sequences into historical order and possibly misunderstand the assumption obviously as mary reappears two images on at the ascension it is out of order i wonder what they thought it was a couple of other things about the east window that you should n't miss firstly everywhere you look there are tiny baskets mortlock calls them 'frails ' and tells us that they were simple rush baskets used by workmen to carry tools also though not in such profusion there are bodices these symbols are repeated elsewhere in the church in stone on tombs and as such must be symbols of the harling family another symbol is high up on the north side a red squirrel curiously this also appears in the painting a lady with a squirrel and a starling by hans holbein now thought to be a portrait of anne lovell the squirrel is a symbol of the lovell family who took over the local manor here from the harlings in the 0th century and the starling represents ea well you guess in july 0 chris harrison and i came across some more glass from east harling in the norfolk county archaeologist service archive at gressenhall it was probably removed from the church for safety in 0 and then not replaced possibly ending up at the museum of church art in norwich at st peter hungate disappearing into storage when that closed in 0 it depicts a bishop and christ seated in majesty and the lozenges in between carry the telltale frails and bodices familiar from other glass within the church within the screen is a large chapel containing two major tombs one is in alabaster an early 0th century memorial to sir thomas and lady alice lovell remember the squirrel who died in 0 the piece is good too good its 0s restoration gives it a festival of britain air their symbols lie at their feet his a magnificent peacock hers a gruesome saracen scalp held aloft the other appears to be a composite it lies to the east and the two effigies are clearly not from this tomb they simply do n't fit they are supposed to be robert harling died paris in 0 and his wife dame joan neither are buried here she is at rushford near thetford he is in some corner of a foreign field that is forever french schoolchildren on picnics excitedly tugging old thighbones from the soil but in any case it is the trimmings of the tomb rather than the effigies that are most of interest including a pelican in her piety and one that is almost a lily crucifix on the north side of the chancel is a fine tomb with brass inlays the brasses now gone not as magnificent as either of the two previously mentioned it is actually the most

14780629438 awe vii presentation in the temple joseph carries the doves mary offers the child to simeon st peter and st paul east harling norfolk with its aisles clerestory porch and chancel st peter and st paul is a textbook example of its century although there are a number of curiosities that add even more interest the vestry on the north side of the chancel for example which was once a shrine chapel retains its image niche on its eastern face and there are more image niches these with elaborate foliage pedestals in the buttresses of the tower everything is topped off by a lead and timber fleche which was apparently the model for the one at st peter mancroft in norwich a church which has several features in common with this one the tower is a delight the buttressing and pinnacles exactly in proportion to make it appear to rise like a fairy castle from the ground the south porch by contrast is despite its flushwork rather austere a result of its rebuilding early in the 0th century before the ecclesiological movement took hold all in all this is as good as 0th century rebuilding gets the money coming thanks to anne harling having no less than three husbands who all wanted to spend as little time in purgatory as possible you step down into a wide space which on a dull day can be rather gloomy although inevitably heavily restored by the victorians st peter and st paul does not have that depressingly anonymous urban feel you so often find in churches of this size this is partly because the beautiful parclose screen in the south aisle partitions off so much space creating a sense of rooms within rooms altering the way your eyes are inevitably drawn to the east the rood screen must have been vast here its dado survives at the west end a deeply traceried affair with its features presented in carving rather than painting when the rood screen was in its proper place to move from the nave into the chancel must have been like stepping from darkness into light this is because of the feature that makes east harling famous the vast east window with its 0th century glass after st peter mancroft it is the best collection in norfolk unusually the provenance of the glass is fairly well documented we can be fairly certain that it came from this church originally still present after the reformation it was removed by the harling family to the hall in the early 0th century they may have been laudians wanting to preserve it from the intentions of the puritans or merely thought it would look nice in their dining hall whatever we know that shortly before francis blomefield visited here in the 0s it was returned to the church and set in its present configuration in 0 when war threatened it was removed again being reset just before cautley visited in the early 0s there are parts of at least three sequences here two of which were almost certainly in the east window originally and one which almost certainly wasn't essentially the window contains two rosary sequences the joyful mysteries of the blessed virgin which include the annunciation the nativity and the assumption and the sorrowful mysteries of the blessed virgin which include the crucifixion and the deposition however this is open to interpretation as we shall see there is also the figure of st mary magdalene which may once have been associated with a nave altar and would have been located in a window there the five lights contain four rows of panels making twenty altogether top row i annunciation mary at her prayer desk gabriel crowned and haloed with a sceptre of lilies kneels in supplication ii visitation elizabeth hooded to show her age places her hand on mary 's pregnant belly iii nativity two midwives look on the infant in the manger is rayed a horned cow gazes in awe iv adoration of the shepherds one holds a lamb one plays pipes a third appears to offer a fleece v adoration of the magi two of the wise men gauge each others ' reactions as the third offers his gift second row vi collection of fragments vii presentation in the temple joseph carries the doves mary offers the child to simeon anna is not shown viii the finding in the temple head covered mary bursts in among the men to find her son teaching ix the wedding at canaa christ seated at the top table blesses a chicken and a ham mary directs the servant x collection of fragments third row xi mary of magdala mary holds her long hair ready to anoint christ 's feet probably not from this window originally xii the betrayal at gethsemane judas kisses christ peter cuts off the ear of the high priest 's servant xiii crucifixion mary swoons in john 's arms xiv deposition from the cross the pieta tears spring from mary 's eyes xv assumption of the blessed virgin mary is assumed bodily into heaven bottom row xvi donor probably robert wingfield second husband of anne harling xvii resurrection christ steps fully clothed from the tomb unusually the soldiers are awake xviii ascension of christ mary surrounded by disciples watches as her son ascends to heaven xix descent of the holy spirit mary surrounded by disciples receives the holy spirit at pentecost xx donor probably william chamberlain first husband of anne harling nowadays we tend to think of the rosary as consisting of three sequences of five mysteries each but in the late middle ages things were much more flexible and rosary sequences often consisted of seven mysteries the glorious mysteries sequence of which the assumption is now a part is a later development and the two adorations shown here are subsumed into a single mystery there are a couple of images here that do n't quite fit the wedding at canaa is obviously a marian text and yet is not traditionally a rosary subject similarly the betrayal the only one of the images not to feature mary i wonder if what we have here are parts of two separate sequences a marian sequence of mysteries i v vii ix xv and a passion sequence xii xiv xvii xix they are both clearly the work of the same workshop and mary is always shown with the same face and dress but this would not preclude them from being two sequences why were they here at all we need to get away from thinking of such things as a 'poor man 's bible ' the need for which was superseded at the reformation these were devotional objects designed to be used as meditations while praying and saying the rosary they were created in the 0th century a time when the mind of the church was fiercely concentrated on asserting orthodox catholic doctrine in the face of local superstitions and abuses as such they were anathema to the reformers and were later elsewhere destroyed for being superstitious not for being superfluous an 0th century antiquarian mind ignorant of the nature of catholic devotion might easily mix the two sequences into historical order and possibly misunderstand the assumption obviously as mary reappears two images on at the ascension it is out of order i wonder what they thought it was a couple of other things about the east window that you should n't miss firstly everywhere you look there are tiny baskets mortlock calls them 'frails ' and tells us that they were simple rush baskets used by workmen to carry tools also though not in such profusion there are bodices these symbols are repeated elsewhere in the church in stone on tombs and as such must be symbols of the harling family another symbol is high up on the north side a red squirrel curiously this also appears in the painting a lady with a squirrel and a starling by hans holbein now thought to be a portrait of anne lovell the squirrel is a symbol of the lovell family who took over the local manor here from the harlings in the 0th century and the starling represents ea well you guess in july 0 chris harrison and i came across some more glass from east harling in the norfolk county archaeologist service archive at gressenhall it was probably removed from the church for safety in 0 and then not replaced possibly ending up at the museum of church art in norwich at st peter hungate disappearing into storage when that closed in 0 it depicts a bishop and christ seated in majesty and the lozenges in between carry the telltale frails and bodices familiar from other glass within the church within the screen is a large chapel containing two major tombs one is in alabaster an early 0th century memorial to sir thomas and lady alice lovell remember the squirrel who died in 0 the piece is good too good its 0s restoration gives it a festival of britain air their symbols lie at their feet his a magnificent peacock hers a gruesome saracen scalp held aloft the other appears to be a composite it lies to the east and the two effigies are clearly not from this tomb they simply do n't fit they are supposed to be robert harling died paris in 0 and his wife dame joan neither are buried here she is at rushford near thetford he is in some corner of a foreign field that is forever french schoolchildren on picnics excitedly tugging old thighbones from the soil but in any case it is the trimmings of the tomb rather than the effigies that are most of interest including a pelican in her piety and one that is almost a lily crucifix on the north side of the chancel is a fine tomb with brass inlays the brasses now gone not as magnificent as either of the two

14856501340 awe canoe trip super moon rises over former republic steel site buffalo river august 0 night photography fro a bobbing canoe is pretty hard so i played the odds and took enough photos that a few had to come out somewhat clearer not great but ok buffalo was once a national center of heavy industry it still has one of the nation 's most versatile and dense rail hubs until the 0s the shores of the river were lined edge to edge with heavy industry steel iron chemicals grain cement petroleum and many smaller industries once hummed 0 0 now the shores are largely abandoned although once can still see the sea walls pilings and remnants of docks where the massive lake freighters navigated up through the buffalo river 's sinuous channels to park often 0 end to end and 0 deep unlike the massive silos down the river nearer to lake erie these industries were torn down the buildings razed and the machinery sold for scrap it 's amazing how little remains of the some of the world 's most powerful industrial centers only the docks and sheet pilings show where freighters docked and unloaded piles of ore limestone and coal that reached several stories tall they are eerie weedy overgrown fields the railroad bridges also still remain and are still part of one of the nation 's important rail hubs connecting lake erie to the interior of the us the legacy of buffalo 's industry can be seen in the incredibly ornate buildings and rich history however another legacy of these industries is some extreme pollution in the 0s when the last of the heavy industry closed the land around this river was so badly contaminated as to be uninhabitable the river itself was essentially dead it had a permanent rainbow hue and smelled like petroleum the mud is contaminated with almost every chemical and metal one can think of and almost no life could survive except for noxious invasive weeds and species in 0 the river caught fire as a welder 's spark ignited thick goopy mats of crude oil sewage poured in and at times the industries drew so much water for cooling that the river flowed in reverse and the temperature changed as mentioned above ships once choked the harbor necessitating creation of mazes of canals intensive dredging hardening of shorelines all which changed the flow and ecology of the river forever the river is slowly recovering due to epa regulations and loss of industry while they were awe inspiring and spawned great wealth and innovation for about 0 years their legacy is mixed perhaps if they were still employing tens of thousands workers and building the local economy one could possibly forgive their uninformed and sloppy environmental past and feel more sympathy for their plight in the modern world when they locked the gates for the last time they went away no longer a legal person anymore and consciously legally and deliberately left their leaking tanks and pipes and transformers and ponds of chemicals piles of slag radioactivity mounds of asbestos soot and coke waste etc thus rebuilding the river and protecting it is now more important because the benefits of business are just too fleeting to be justified this night trip reminds me that the river is for people and should not be allowed to degrade so badly again a wonderful night warm with a pleasant breeze pleasent company and a huge full moon to light the way what more could one ask for

14900829210 awe eagle caps and imnaha canyon in the distance are the wallowa mountains the eagle caps above joseph oregon in between is the deep canyon cut by the imnaha river which joins the snake river below hells canyon we could n't linger here long as we wanted to get to a place to camp on the road to hat point we found a wonderful place to camp at saddle creek canyon campground on june 0th of 0 my wife and i headed for hat point on the oregon rim of hell 's canyon we had never been there and wanted to see the landscapes wildflowers and fire lookout tower we did n't make it in 0 we arrived at the small quot village quot of imnaha oregon and it was getting late we asked at the old grocery store cafe in town the only one if there was a place we could camp for the night nearby we were driving our 0 0 x 0 toyota pickup truck and we had a nice bed under a canopy in the back the young lady at the store directed us to a quot parking lot quot just a couple hundred yards up the hill from the store it was a gravel parking lot and the only thing that identified it as a quot camping place quot was an older model porta potty no water no picnic tables just a level gravel lot with a porta potty we had paid just 0 0 and since we were the only quot campers quot that night it was quiet and served its purpose the next morning we started up the steep dirt road toward hat point it was a gorgeous morning with the imnaha river canyon walls covered with bright green early summer grass and decorated with wildflowers like lupine and balsam root we topped out of the canyon and drove perhaps a dozen miles when we reached snow a foot or more deep which covered and blocked the road we were several miles short of our hat point destination but certainly did n't consider the attempt a failure the landscapes were big bold and beautiful and we vowed to return some day fast forward tuesday august 0th 0 my wife and i headed for hat point once again we had just purchased a 0 nissan frontier 0 x 0 pickup truck and put a canopy on the back and a mattress inside for old folks camping in comfort it needed some dirt road travel to properly break it in ha in addition to our destination of the hat point fire lookout tower it was my hope that the dirt road up the imnaha river from the village of imnaha to forest service road 0 would be open so we could drive it for the first time it was and we did the next day as with our 0 road trip we arrived fairly late in the day at imnaha oregon we had to drive slowly and carefully from joseph to imnaha due to all the mule deer on or near the road at that time of day some cute little spotted fawns along the way with their mothers we had enough time to make it to one of the two campgrounds shown on our maps campgrounds come and go in the back country so we did n't know if either or both would be open or even there anymore so up the steep grade of the imnaha river canyon we climbed a big surprise a wildfire had swept up the canyon not too long ago so everything below the road which had served as a fire break and fire fighting line was scorched what a difference from the june of 0 condition of that part of the canyon we soon passed through the wildfire burned area and into the pine trees on top the canyon rim a mother elk and her young calf watched us go by and a few deer darted into the woods as we slowly made progress up the road we saw one car coming down the dirt road in the burned section and we would not see another vehicle nor another person until we returned to the village of imnaha the next day it was getting dark by the time we reached saddle creek canyon campground about 0 camping spots with an outhouse picnic tables and fire pits and a view that would knock your socks off the campground was perched on the hells canyon rim overlooking where the snake river makes its way through hells canyon and the impressive seven devils mountains across the canyon on the idaho side no other campers no fee beautiful spot done deal we set up camp which consisted of parking the truck and rolling out our sleeping bags on the mattress in the back of the pickup truck easy opened the canopy windows for a screened light breeze closed the tailgate and canopy rear window and we had a great place to sleep the air was cool since the campground was located at 0 ft it would be a four or five mile drive the next morning to check out the views the road the fire lookout and the sacagawea campground near the fire lookout that was shown on at least one of our maps there were four highlights of this road trip the stars above our camp at saddle creek canyon the fire lookout at hat point and view from near the top three imnaha river otter we would encounter the next morning and a short distance farther up the river a big but cautious desert canyon black bear about midnight tuesday night i felt the quot need quot to open up the rear window of our truck canopy and step outside for a short trip to outhouse too much diet pepsi when i stepped outside i was honestly overwhelmed and awed by the night sky black sky full of bright white stars the milky way clearly visible overhead and because we were above 0 ft on a canyon rim peninsula the stars wrapped all the way around out camp it was an outstanding view no city lights to dampen the sharp contrast between stars and black sky matrix beautiful i got up before my wife the next morning and roamed the canyon rim with my camera while she got some extra sleep soon though we were on our way to hat point nice drive impressive fire lookout tower and the views from the quot visitors ' platform quot of the fire lookout would be difficult to beat to the northeast we could see the snake river up river from pittsburg landing where my wife and i have camped and hiked before and where we started a jet boat trip one year that took us through some impressive rapids by historic ranches and all the way to hells canyon dam fireweed and indian paintbrush were in bloom everywhere around the fire lookout tower in 0 a wildfire swept the area of the fire lookout and alert and resourceful rangers saved the fire lookout from burning by wrapping the base in fireproof kevlar we put the pickup in four wheel drive and checked out the quot site quot of the sacagawea quot dispersed camping quot campground forget it it is going to seed and would n't interest us as a place to camp not after being spoiled at saddle creek canyon campground after our visit to hat point and the fire lookout tower we slowly drove back to the town of imnaha stopping at vistas such as granny 's viewpoint which has a nice looping paved path giving you dramatic views of the imnaha river canyon below and the eagle cap mountains to the west all of this and we were the only two people in the area on wednesday morning how i love back roads good to have a wife who enjoys exploring places like this as well my wife and i have driven the forest service road 0 between the road from brownlee dam to halfway oregon and joseph several times in both directions but lately that road has been closed due to slides and flooding so it has n't been all that dependable a route to count on signs at imnaha indicated one hour delays on fr 0 on the brownlee dam end of the route having never driven the dirt road up the imnaha river to where it meets forest road 0 that is where we headed the river is clear and lovely the upper river where we had visited before has a multi colored free stone bed river and is fast running cold and clear lots of private land on either side of the river i had to chuckle at the numerous and bright signs stating private property no trespassing no hunting no fishing violators prosecuted to the full extent of the law it did n't mention survivors would be prosecuted but the message was clear ca n't blame ranchers and farmers though with the way some people treat the land and occasionally livestock are accidentally shot by hunters still does n't no trespassing pretty much cover it i mean if you ca n't trespass it should be pretty self evident that you ca n't hunt fish picnic gather mushrooms or frolic no trespassing private propery should pretty much cover it so way up the river was a sign indicating that the next nine tenths of a mile the imnaha river was open to public access fishing it was here i pulled over under a pine tree so my wife and i could have a tailgate lunch picnic there may be nine tenths of a mile of river quot available quot to the public but it looked like you would have to have rappelling equipment and the requisite rappelling skills to exercise that option here though was the prettiest stretch of the imnaha river we saw deep pools white frothing rapids and a short waterfalls or two made this an appealing stretch of river while my wife was preparing our tailgate picnic i spotted three huge fish in the river but they were too big to be fish even for salmon or steelhead they were three river otter playing like otter do as they made their way down the river headed for a lively white water section of the river what a show i ran along the dirt road above the river observing the otter and trying my best to get some kind of photograph of them but they appeared and disappeared with ease so the only decent photos i got of them is when as a group they made the decision not to go over the small waterfalls but to quot portage themselves quot along the solid rock right bank of the river what a wonderful experience it was to view these wild river otter in what seemed to me a most unusual environment all the limited river access meant light fishing pressure so the three otter took full advantage of the situation after watching the otter glide downstream i spotted a nice sized steelhead in the river otter certainly had a great place to live and find a meal after lunch we started on up the river we had n't gone more than a mile or two when i saw what looked like a large black newfoundland dog making its way to the river i did n't expect to see otter in the river and i certainly did n't expect to encounter a black bear either but that was what it was my wife said quot bear quot before the fact had registered with me that she was right to keep this short i did n't get a photograph of the bear to corroborate the sighting when i stopped the truck the bear did a 0 and returned to the brush bordering the river it turned and looked at us i backed up to where i had a clear view of the bear and when i lowered the window to take a photo off went the bear i would have loved to have been able to get a photo of a black bear in such an unlikely location but it was n't to be that 's the story we returned to joseph oregon on forest service road 0 then took another route toward home we drove by joseph canyon on to anatone and then into lewiston and clarkston where we spent some time we slept in the back of the truck again wednesday night and got up early to head back home on thursday morning once again a fun road trip and you never know what you will see when traveling america 's back roads which are treasures as are the small towns along the way enjoy some of the photos we took on this

14926899905 sadness if i could take the pain away the suicide of robin williams was a shock to the many fans of the talented actor and comedian we wondered what could have been done to prevent such a tragedy many people have posted on social media about depression awareness yet we know that many more people will commit suicide despite the relatively short lived attention to this cause for the past fifteen years i 've lived with physical pain that has made me feel nearly hopeless yet i never thought to end this life of mine simply because it is all i know dying to me is like leaving while the party is still going for someone to get to the point of no return is something i can not fathom and i feel for them the phrase quot this too shall pass quot is something i know from experience i 've had days and even weeks of deep anxiety not knowing what my future holds only to see things work out although i shot this in april before my son was born i did n't feel compelled to post it until now in an effort to show the importance of expression in portraiture work i thought about showing sadness inspired by jeremy cowart 's work with john schneider after the dukes of hazzard star found out that his dad passed away it is lamentable that many people do n't have a great relationship with their father but i am very fortunate i have a fondness for my own father that i hope my son will have for me it is this love that got me into this emotional state as it has been said that actors do n't act they react my secret is watching a great father son movie the way starring dayton ohio native martin sheen and his son emilio estevez the movie follows a father who walks the el camino de santiago in place of his son who dies early on the route it is a very heartwarming sentimental movie that really focuses on the meaningfulness of relationships we live for a very short time and we should cherish the connections we make with others

15084707749 awe the bells were ringing the ever awe inspiring st pauls
15087333445 awe imnaha river canyon after a fire in the distance are the eagle cap mountains above lake wallowa and joseph oregon below is the imnaha river canyon a wildfire had swept the canyon wall in a small area of the hat point fire lookout area it was at this exact spot that i photographed wildflowers and a spring green canyon back in june of 0 on june 0th of 0 my wife and i headed for hat point on the oregon rim of hell 's canyon we had never been there and wanted to see the landscapes wildflowers and fire lookout tower we did n't make it in 0 we arrived at the small quot village quot of imnaha oregon and it was getting late we asked at the old grocery store cafe in town the only one if there was a place we could camp for the night nearby we were driving our 0 0 x 0 toyota pickup truck and we had a nice bed under a canopy in the back the young lady at the store directed us to a quot parking lot quot just a couple hundred yards up the hill from the store it was a gravel parking lot and the only thing that identified it as a quot camping place quot was an older model porta potty no water no picnic tables just a level gravel lot with a porta potty we had paid just 0 0 and since we were the only quot campers quot that night it was quiet and served its purpose the next morning we started up the steep dirt road toward hat point it was a gorgeous morning with the imnaha river canyon walls covered with bright green early summer grass and decorated with wildflowers like lupine and balsam root we topped out of the canyon and drove perhaps a dozen miles when we reached snow a foot or more deep which covered and blocked the road we were several miles short of our hat point destination but certainly did n't consider the attempt a failure the landscapes were big bold and beautiful and we vowed to return some day fast forward tuesday august 0th 0 my wife and i headed for hat point once again we had just purchased a 0 nissan frontier 0 x 0 pickup truck and put a canopy on the back and a mattress inside for old folks camping in comfort it needed some dirt road travel to properly break it in ha in addition to our destination of the hat point fire lookout tower it was my hope that the dirt road up the imnaha river from the village of imnaha to forest service road 0 would be open so we could drive it for the first time it was and we did the next day as with our 0 road trip we arrived fairly late in the day at imnaha oregon we had to drive slowly and carefully from joseph to imnaha due to all the mule deer on or near the road at that time of day some cute little spotted fawns along the way with their mothers we had enough time to make it to one of the two campgrounds shown on our maps campgrounds come and go in the back country so we did n't know if either or both would be open or even there anymore so up the steep grade of the imnaha river canyon we climbed a big surprise a wildfire had swept up the canyon not too long ago so everything below the road which had served as a fire break and fire fighting line was scorched what a difference from the june of 0 condition of that part of the canyon we soon passed through the wildfire burned area and into the pine trees on top the canyon rim a mother elk and her young calf watched us go by and a few deer darted into the woods as we slowly made progress up the road we saw one car coming down the dirt road in the burned section and we would not see another vehicle nor another person until we returned to the village of imnaha the next day it was getting dark by the time we reached saddle creek canyon campground about 0 camping spots with an outhouse picnic tables and fire pits and a view that would knock your socks off the campground was perched on the hells canyon rim overlooking where the snake river makes its way through hells canyon and the impressive seven devils mountains across the canyon on the idaho side no other campers no fee beautiful spot done deal we set up camp which consisted of parking the truck and rolling out our sleeping bags on the mattress in the back of the pickup truck easy opened the canopy windows for a screened light breeze closed the tailgate and canopy rear window and we had a great place to sleep the air was cool since the campground was located at 0 ft it would be a four or five mile drive the next morning to check out the views the road the fire lookout and the sacagawea campground near the fire lookout that was shown on at least one of our maps there were four highlights of this road trip the stars above our camp at saddle creek canyon the fire lookout at hat point and view from near the top three imnaha river otter we would encounter the next morning and a short distance farther up the river a big but cautious desert canyon black bear about midnight tuesday night i felt the quot need quot to open up the rear window of our truck canopy and step outside for a short trip to outhouse too much diet pepsi when i stepped outside i was honestly overwhelmed and awed by the night sky black sky full of bright white stars the milky way clearly visible overhead and because we were above 0 ft on a canyon rim peninsula the stars wrapped all the way around out camp it was an outstanding view no city lights to dampen the sharp contrast between stars and black sky matrix beautiful i got up before my wife the next morning and roamed the canyon rim with my camera while she got some extra sleep soon though we were on our way to hat point nice drive impressive fire lookout tower and the views from the quot visitors ' platform quot of the fire lookout would be difficult to beat to the northeast we could see the snake river up river from pittsburg landing where my wife and i have camped and hiked before and where we started a jet boat trip one year that took us through some impressive rapids by historic ranches and all the way to hells canyon dam fireweed and indian paintbrush were in bloom everywhere around the fire lookout tower in 0 a wildfire swept the area of the fire lookout and alert and resourceful rangers saved the fire lookout from burning by wrapping the base in fireproof kevlar we put the pickup in four wheel drive and checked out the quot site quot of the sacagawea quot dispersed camping quot campground forget it it is going to seed and would n't interest us as a place to camp not after being spoiled at saddle creek canyon campground after our visit to hat point and the fire lookout tower we slowly drove back to the town of imnaha stopping at vistas such as granny 's viewpoint which has a nice looping paved path giving you dramatic views of the imnaha river canyon below and the eagle cap mountains to the west all of this and we were the only two people in the area on wednesday morning how i love back roads good to have a wife who enjoys exploring places like this as well my wife and i have driven the forest service road 0 between the road from brownlee dam to halfway oregon and joseph several times in both directions but lately that road has been closed due to slides and flooding so it has n't been all that dependable a route to count on signs at imnaha indicated one hour delays on fr 0 on the brownlee dam end of the route having never driven the dirt road up the imnaha river to where it meets forest road 0 that is where we headed the river is clear and lovely the upper river where we had visited before has a multi colored free stone bed river and is fast running cold and clear lots of private land on either side of the river i had to chuckle at the numerous and bright signs stating private property no trespassing no hunting no fishing violators prosecuted to the full extent of the law it did n't mention survivors would be prosecuted but the message was clear ca n't blame ranchers and farmers though with the way some people treat the land and occasionally livestock are accidentally shot by hunters still does n't no trespassing pretty much cover it i mean if you ca n't trespass it should be pretty self evident that you ca n't hunt fish picnic gather mushrooms or frolic no trespassing private propery should pretty much cover it so way up the river was a sign indicating that the next nine tenths of a mile the imnaha river was open to public access fishing it was here i pulled over under a pine tree so my wife and i could have a tailgate lunch picnic there may be nine tenths of a mile of river quot available quot to the public but it looked like you would have to have rappelling equipment and the requisite rappelling skills to exercise that option here though was the prettiest stretch of the imnaha river we saw deep pools white frothing rapids and a short waterfalls or two made this an appealing stretch of river while my wife was preparing our tailgate picnic i spotted three huge fish in the river but they were too big to be fish even for salmon or steelhead they were three river otter playing like otter do as they made their way down the river headed for a lively white water section of the river what a show i ran along the dirt road above the river observing the otter and trying my best to get some kind of photograph of them but they appeared and disappeared with ease so the only decent photos i got of them is when as a group they made the decision not to go over the small waterfalls but to quot portage themselves quot along the solid rock right bank of the river what a wonderful experience it was to view these wild river otter in what seemed to me a most unusual environment all the limited river access meant light fishing pressure so the three otter took full advantage of the situation after watching the otter glide downstream i spotted a nice sized steelhead in the river otter certainly had a great place to live and find a meal after lunch we started on up the river we had n't gone more than a mile or two when i saw what looked like a large black newfoundland dog making its way to the river i did n't expect to see otter in the river and i certainly did n't expect to encounter a black bear either but that was what it was my wife said quot bear quot before the fact had registered with me that she was right to keep this short i did n't get a photograph of the bear to corroborate the sighting when i stopped the truck the bear did a 0 and returned to the brush bordering the river it turned and looked at us i backed up to where i had a clear view of the bear and when i lowered the window to take a photo off went the bear i would have loved to have been able to get a photo of a black bear in such an unlikely location but it was n't to be that 's the story we returned to joseph oregon on forest service road 0 then took another route toward home we drove by joseph canyon on to anatone and then into lewiston and clarkston where we spent some time we slept in the back of the truck again wednesday night and got up early to head back home on thursday morning once again a fun road trip and you never know what you will see when traveling america 's back roads which are treasures as are the small towns along the way enjoy some of the photos we took on this short three day road trip mr and

another person until we returned to the village of imnaha the next day it was getting dark by the time we reached saddle creek canyon campground about 0 camping spots with an outhouse picnic tables and fire pits and a view that would knock your socks off the campground was perched on the hells canyon rim overlooking where the snake river makes its way through hells canyon and the impressive seven devils mountains across the canyon on the idaho side no other campers no fee beautiful spot done deal we set up camp which consisted of parking the truck and rolling out our sleeping bags on the mattress in the back of the pickup truck easy opened the canopy windows for a screened light breeze closed the tailgate and canopy rear window and we had a great place to sleep the air was cool since the campground was located at 0 ft it would be a four or five mile drive the next morning to check out the views the road the fire lookout and the sacagawea campground near the fire lookout that was shown on at least one of our maps there were four highlights of this road trip the stars above our camp at saddle creek canyon the fire lookout at hat point and view from near the top three imnaha river otter we would encounter the next morning and a short distance farther up the river a big but cautious desert canyon black bear about midnight tuesday night i felt the quot need quot to open up the rear window of our truck canopy and step outside for a short trip to outhouse too much diet pepsi when i stepped outside i was honestly overwhelmed and awed by the night sky black sky full of bright white stars the milky way clearly visible overhead and because we were above 0 ft on a canyon rim peninsula the stars wrapped all the way around out camp it was an outstanding view no city lights to dampen the sharp contrast between stars and black sky matrix beautiful i got up before my wife the next morning and roamed the canyon rim with my camera while she got some extra sleep soon though we were on our way to hat point nice drive impressive fire lookout tower and the views from the quot visitors ' platform quot of the fire lookout would be difficult to beat to the northeast we could see the snake river up river from pittsburg landing where my wife and i have camped and hiked before and where we started a jet boat trip one year that took us through some impressive rapids by historic ranches and all the way to hells canyon dam fireweed and indian paintbrush were in bloom everywhere around the fire lookout tower in 0 a wildfire swept the area of the fire lookout and alert and resourceful rangers saved the fire lookout from burning by wrapping the base in fireproof kevlar we put the pickup in four wheel drive and checked out the quot site quot of the sacagawea quot dispersed camping quot campground forget it it is going to seed and would n't interest us as a place to camp not after being spoiled at saddle creek canyon campground after our visit to hat point and the fire lookout tower we slowly drove back to the town of imnaha stopping at vistas such as granny 's viewpoint which has a nice looping paved path giving you dramatic views of the imnaha river canyon below and the eagle cap mountains to the west all of this and we were the only two people in the area on wednesday morning how i love back roads good to have a wife who enjoys exploring places like this as well my wife and i have driven the forest service road 0 between the road from brownlee dam to halfway oregon and joseph several times in both directions but lately that road has been closed due to slides and flooding so it has n't been all that dependable a route to count on signs at imnaha indicated one hour delays on fr 0 on the brownlee dam end of the route having never driven the dirt road up the imnaha river to where it meets forest road 0 that is where we headed the river is clear and lovely the upper river where we had visited before has a multi colored free stone bed river and is fast running cold and clear lots of private land on either side of the river i had to chuckle at the numerous and bright signs stating private property no trespassing no hunting no fishing violators prosecuted to the full extent of the law it did n't mention survivors would be prosecuted but the message was clear ca n't blame ranchers and farmers though with the way some people treat the land and occasionally livestock are accidentally shot by hunters still does n't no trespassing pretty much cover it i mean if you ca n't trespass it should be pretty self evident that you ca n't hunt fish picnic gather mushrooms or frolic no trespassing private propery should pretty much cover it so way up the river was a sign indicating that the next nine tenths of a mile the imnaha river was open to public access fishing it was here i pulled over under a pine tree so my wife and i could have a tailgate lunch picnic there may be nine tenths of a mile of river quot available quot to the public but it looked like you would have to have rappelling equipment and the requisite rappelling skills to exercise that option here though was the prettiest stretch of the imnaha river we saw deep pools white frothing rapids and a short waterfalls or two made this an appealing stretch of river while my wife was preparing our tailgate picnic i spotted three huge fish in the river but they were too big to be fish even for salmon or steelhead they were three river otter playing like otter do as they made their way down the river headed for a lively white water section of the river what a show i ran along the dirt road above the river observing the otter and trying my best to get some kind of photograph of them but they appeared and disappeared with ease so the only decent photos i got of them is when as a group they made the decision not to go over the small waterfalls but to quot portage themselves quot along the solid rock right bank of the river what a wonderful experience it was to view these wild river otter in what seemed to me a most unusual environment all the limited river access meant light fishing pressure so the three otter took full advantage of the situation after watching the otter glide downstream i spotted a nice sized steelhead in the river otter certainly had a great place to live and find a meal after lunch we started on up the river we had n't gone more than a mile or two when i saw what looked like a large black newfoundland dog making its way to the river i did n't expect to see otter in the river and i certainly did n't expect to encounter a black bear either but that was what it was my wife said quot bear quot before the fact had registered with me that she was right to keep this short i did n't get a photograph of the bear to corroborate the sighting when i stopped the truck the bear did a 0 and returned to the brush bordering the river it turned and looked at us i backed up to where i had a clear view of the bear and when i lowered the window to take a photo off went the bear i would have loved to have been able to get a photo of a black bear in such an unlikely location but it was n't to be that 's the story we returned to joseph oregon on forest service road 0 then took another route toward home we drove by joseph canyon on to anatone and then into lewiston and clarkston where we spent some time we slept in the back of the truck again wednesday night and got up early to head back home on thursday morning once again a fun road trip and you never know what you will see when traveling america 's back roads which are treasures as are the small towns along the way enjoy some of the photos we took on this short three day road trip mr and mrs omt 0 august 0 here are a few links from our june 0 road trip

proportions and claim passing ships as her own the superstitious seek to appease her greedy and tempestuous nature with offerings of gold jewels and shrimp of which she is partial cast over board for safe passage on the seas her watery abode is at the bottom of an abyssal ravine in the skeletal remains of an ancient leviathan surrounded by a garden of shipwrecks and the bones of drowned mariners only the brave or the very foolish seek her advice for the sea witch is cunning and devious and the bargains she strikes are always rigged in her favour and she is not averse to bending the rules to get what she wants and what ursula really wants is to be ruler over the ocean and everything it one dark night when the sky was as black as ink ursula rose from the depths into a secluded cove by a vast dense forest she had been summoned by a frail looking old pedlar woman who standing on a wooden jetty holding the conch shell that had summoned her angry at being summoned like some dog fish and by an old hag ursula lashed out with her tentacles but with a quick gesture of her hand a bolt of green light sparked from the old womans fingers and struck the sea witchs tentacles with a sizzling crack leaving blistering marks gnashing her teeth in pain ursula retracted her tentacles and glared at the pedlar woman do not mistake this frail appearance for weakness sea witch for i am grimhilde former apprentice to the powerful sorcerer yensid and once queen of these lands and unless you wish to be turned into calamari you should listen to what i have to say for i have a deal to make with you ursula conceded and listened to the hags proposal my mirror has shown me that four tides ago you rose from your abode and claimed a ship as your own and dragged it to the depths as is my right as witch of the sea ursula cut in grimhilde twitched her hand in warning and ursula fell silent and grimhilde continued that ship had something of mine on it a chest i had sent my pirate servant to claim it for me which he successfully did however the key that opens said chest was lost to me during your attack ursula was growing impatient why not smash the chest open and be done with it grimhilde explained that the chest is protected by magic and can only be opened by the key which has the counter spell on it she went onto say that her mirror had shown that the key was claimed by a little mermaid who witnessed the attack and saved the prince who was wearing the key on a chain round his neck and that is why i now find myself of need of your assistance for i am now in a fortunate position to kill two birds with one stone so to speak the mermaid will be paying you a visit in three tides time she is a curious soul and wishes to visit the world above and believes you can help her and so you shall but of course payment is required grimhilde told ursula the specific payments required to which she replied but what do i get out of this why should i help you i have no wish to help love sick mermaids let alone a fallen queen did i fail to mention that this little mermaid is king tritons youngest daughter at this revelation ursulas interest was hooked the sea king would do anything to get his precious daughter back even surrender that which your heart desires the trident ursula said triumphantly with it i shall finally be able to rule the sea and all its spoils shall bow to my power however if you fail to bring me what i have asked you shall be summoned again sea witch and no amount of bargaining shall save your tentacles do we have a deal grimhilde asked oh i shall help that poor unfortunate soul and then her fathers trident shall belong to me yes we have a bargain and with a cackling laugh ursula sunk back beneath the waves three tides later just as the hag had said the mermaid entered ursulas domain asking for ursulas help my dear sweet child of course i shall help you thats what i do and your prince is quiet the catch isnt he the potion i brew will turn you into a human for six tides thats three daysin those three days you must get the prince to fall in love with you or else you shall turn back into a mermaid and you shall belong to me do we have a deal the little mermaid agreed to ursulas deal and the sea witch continued there is one matter we must discuss the subject of payment but i dont have that trinket round your neck yes hand it over this shall do as one part of the payment i have nothing else to give two legs two payments what i want from you isyour voice i hear it is quite enchanting the little mermaid sadly agreed to the sea witchs bargain and sung her voice into ursulas shell necklace where it glowed bright and golden sea witch then brewed a potion to transform the mermaids tail into a lovely pair of human legs clasping it in her hands the mermaid swam up and up to shore of the princes kingdom to drink the potion ursula returned to the secluded cove and found the hag grimhilde waiting for her everything thing went swimmingly soon king tritons daughter will be mine and then ill make him writhe and i shall have the trident yes yes yes but did you bring your side of the bargain ursula smiling wickedly handed over the key and the shell necklace containing the voice of the mermaid to grimhilde who took them in her old wrinkled hands with a gloating look in her eyes at last i have everything required to undo my spell and once again become the fairest and most powerful in the land recipe body fat wwe male figure made the nose smaller hair breasts belly apoxie sculpt

15553491843 awe pre sunrise goldman sachs tower jersey city skyline with midtown manhattan empire state building photo 0 of lsp series from liberty state park jersey city nj note the comments that follow will be added to all of the photos from this 0 0 excursion to liberty state park for everything you see is connected to the overall message in one way or another having done a very early morning start at liberty state park on christmas day of 0 while thoroughly enjoying the awe inspiring experience along the waterfront walkway with one of the worlds greatest urban landscapes and waterscape in and around the new york harbor i decided to do the same again this year however given some prior obligations it was the day after christmas instead like the previous year nary a soul besides me was out before sunrise and it was not until about an hour after the sun first appeared that a group of visitors emerged so i basically had the entire waterfront park to myself for a pretty good stretch of time if you have never been there it really is a sight to behold when one can see the majesty of the statue of liberty ellis island with its unique place in american history and the recently completed freedom tower standing above all as the new proud symbol of what every person aspires to possess freedom it took my wife and me quite a few years after the infamous heart wrenching event of the fallen twin towers simply known as 0 0 if you go to our flickr albums you will see the mid to latter construction stage of the freedom tower in photos under new york skylines or the meadowlands landscapes and such initially we both felt that nothing could ever replace or exude the same powerful presence as the original twin towers and felt disappointment in the design of the freedom tower as it began to evolve from ground up but when it reached its latter stages and the way the natural light over the course of any given day would play a significant role in its image an overwhelming sense of admiration for the concept began to grow and when finally completed it all seemed to be a perfect visual symbol to the new landscape of new york harbor as we used to feel driving to the city or passing by from the new jersey side a similar kind of pride is felt with this new great landmark that has made such a significant impact on the psyche of our citizens many of you have likely stopped reading this long narrative but you can probably surmise that aforementioned pride in these comments having personally seen the falling of the twin towers from work three miles away on that horrific weekday morning with all the confused and maddening reports being broadcasted on the radio and television news it becomes an experience that is indelibly forever etched in my mind so that day is always present whenever i look toward the southern anchor of the manhattan skyline and i absolutely love how the freedom tower has not replaced but serves as a natural extension of the twin towers and honors those who have lost their lives accordingly looking farther north offers the empire state building and chrysler building the two iconic skyscrapers that ruled the architectural world of construction beyond imagination in the early 0s and the goldman sachs tower of jersey city on the new jersey side of the hudson river can hold its own amongst the giants of the ny harbor landmarks the captivating style of this particular modern design somehow compliments the glorious manhattan skylinepractically blending in as part of a grand visual sweep from one side of the harbor to the other and furthermore the famous brooklyn bridge can be seen in the distance between the southern end of manhattan and the borough of brooklyn and to the far south the verrazano bridge dominates the entry way to the great harbor that saw thousands upon thousands of aspiring immigrants who traveled the vast atlantic ocean ultimately arriving in america while taking their first step on our soil at ellis island under the protective presence of lady liberty one historic reminder after another permeates the air causing just about everyone to feel something truly special even if visitors know little of the history here it is nearly impossible not to be awe struck in closing the two extreme ends of the waterfront park the northern point and the south lawn offer monuments that are so powerful and captivating i am always taken by the liberation monument which honors all of those who served our nation in the fight for freedom if any of you ever have the chance to visit lsp please do take some time to genuinely appreciate this statue from all angles for it almost comes to life the northern end of the park has the new jersey empty sky 0 0 memorial which must be seen a surge of emotions will flood through your body as you stand at the site and gaze across to the east where the twins once stood anyhow i hope that this passage would serve as a motivating factor to visit liberty state park if possible regardless of the degree of personal meaning this may have it is still a landscape that is well worth the trip nothing like it in the world

done a very early morning start at liberty state park on christmas day of 0 while thoroughly enjoying the awe inspiring experience along the waterfront walkway with one of the worlds greatest urban landscapes and waterscape in and around the new york harbor i decided to do the same again this year however given some prior obligations it was the day after christmas instead like the previous year nary a soul besides me was out before sunrise and it was not until about an hour after the sun first appeared that a group of visitors emerged so i basically had the entire waterfront park to myself for a pretty good stretch of time if you have never been there it really is a sight to behold when one can see the majesty of the statue of liberty ellis island with its unique place in american history and the recently completed freedom tower standing above all as the new proud symbol of what every person aspires to possess freedom it took my wife and me quite a few years after the infamous heart wrenching event of the fallen twin towers simply known as 0 0 if you go to our flickr albums you will see the mid to latter construction stage of the freedom tower in photos under new york skylines or the meadowlands landscapes and such initially we both felt that nothing could ever replace or exude the same powerful presence as the original twin towers and felt disappointment in the design of the freedom tower as it began to evolve from ground up but when it reached its latter stages and the way the natural light over the course of any given day would play a significant role in its image an overwhelming sense of admiration for the concept began to grow and when finally completed it all seemed to be a perfect visual symbol to the new landscape of new york harbor as we used to feel driving to the city or passing by from the new jersey side a similar kind of pride is felt with this new great landmark that has made such a significant impact on the psyche of our citizens many of you have likely stopped reading this long narrative but you can probably surmise that aforementioned pride in these comments having personally seen the falling of the twin towers from work three miles away on that horrific weekday morning with all the confused and maddening reports being broadcasted on the radio and television news it becomes an experience that is indelibly forever etched in my mind so that day is always present whenever i look toward the southern anchor of the manhattan skyline and i absolutely love how the freedom tower has not replaced but serves as a natural extension of the twin towers and honors those who have lost their lives accordingly looking farther north offers the empire state building and chrysler building the two iconic skyscrapers that ruled the architectural world of construction beyond imagination in the early 0s and the goldman sachs tower of jersey city on the new jersey side of the hudson river can hold its own amongst the giants of the ny harbor landmarks the captivating style of this particular modern design somehow compliments the glorious manhattan skylinepractically blending in as part of a grand visual sweep from one side of the harbor to the other and furthermore the famous brooklyn bridge can be seen in the distance between the southern end of manhattan and the borough of brooklyn and to the far south the verrazano bridge dominates the entry way to the great harbor that saw thousands upon thousands of aspiring immigrants who traveled the vast atlantic ocean ultimately arriving in america while taking their first step on our soil at ellis island under the protective presence of lady liberty one historic reminder after another permeates the air causing just about everyone to feel something truly special even if visitors know little of the history here it is nearly impossible not to be awe struck in closing the two extreme ends of the waterfront park the northern point and the south lawn offer monuments that are so powerful and captivating i am always taken by the liberation monument which honors all of those who served our nation in the fight for freedom if any of you ever have the chance to visit lsp please do take some time to genuinely appreciate this statue from all angles for it almost comes to life the northern end of the park has the new jersey empty sky 0 0 memorial which must be seen a surge of emotions will flood through your body as you stand at the site and gaze across to the east where the twins once stood anyhow i hope that this passage would serve as a motivating factor to visit liberty state park if possible regardless of the degree of personal meaning this may have it is still a landscape that is well worth the trip nothing like it in the world

16085644681 excitement 0 farzi is one restaurant i have wanted to be at the most but it ironically has taken me the longest the reasons for this happening were plenty but i finally made it to farzi last week and there was a sense of excitement and relief in equal measure the place is funky chic and bohemian but i would not want to delve on it any more as it takes my focus away from what makes farzi the best new restaurant in town food and drinks many people label the food here as molecular gastronomy but i think its akin to calling all indian food quot curry quot it strips away from the complexity of what 's on your plate farzi is multi sensory cooking as blumenthal says you do n't just eat with your tongue but your eyes and other senses yes there are elements of molecular gastronomy involved but as my review ahead will tell it is more a take on taking classic combinations or flavours and twisting them around anyway gyaan aside our evening began with a mishti doi lollipop molecular gastronomy spherification to be precise was visible here as soon as you bite into it though you get that fabulous sweet and tart hit of mishti doi even though it was presented in such a fancy way it tasted amazing and authentic next came a drink called apple foamtini a take on the classic apple martini this had a light frothy apple flavoured foam and then a tart cold hit of the great martini brilliant combination and a great drink this next on the menu was a mini raj kachori with okra and chutney foam yeah raj kachori with crisp okra and a chutney foam mind blown the kachori was stuffed with dahi green chutney and the works but guess what it was completely closed after this piece of sorcery when i tasted the kachori it was as good as any delhi 0 outlet the chutney foam gave the quot saunth kick quot but it was way lighter the crisp okra was great and i was told that the idea behind okra was that it goes well with yoghurt this i believe is the spirit of farzi the moment you bite into the food or sip a drink it feels familiar and utterly delectable also every element has a reason to be there not just to be fancy next came a light refreshing orange vanilla drink called farzi ok balanced sweet and sour with a very light flavour of kaffir lime this is what you will want to drink all evening next came a portion of chilli pork ribs very well cooked ribs with a slathering of luscious chilli sauce wonderful i moved onto one of the many superstars on the menu tapas menu sarson ke gilawat with corn and cheese tostadas sarson ka saag becomes a fantastic sarson gilawat kebab here the makki di roti takes the form of corn makki popcorn corn and cheese tostadas provide warmth and there are even elements of safed makhan sirka and pyaaz in this you will fall in love the gastronomic adventure took me to my favourite dish amongst the pantheon of dishes tenderloin pathar ke kabab with walnut and wasabi chutney i 'd say if you like meat have this dish if you do not like meat have this dish dammit if you are vegetarian have this dish it is that good in between we had a palette cleanser rose water and coconut payasam foam with rose petal dust before the prawn tempura with nimbu chutney foam arrived i have never had better prawn tempura in my life period i have to write a bigger review on this alone but lets leave that for now i had the braised lamb chops next along with cheeni ka paratha with duck liver maska cheeni ka paratha was farzified with a foie gras butter and all i could think of was why mom never served such delicious quot cheeni ka parathas quot when i was younger i had the chilli duck samosas pulled pork bun and the galouti burger next i am running out of space to write about how brilliant each dish was the samosa was halwai khasta the duck was flavourful and the sweet plum sauce brought the entire dish together similarly the pulled pork bun was so goan yet so farzi there was flavour from the pork the buns gave it airiness and the goan puffed rice gave it crunch drool the gilawat burger came in a box and the soft and magnificent galouti was given a bit of bite by a layer of boti kebab you have to admire the thought process the mutton irachi pepper fry came along with a malabari paratha and was sublime but the icing on the cake was the gucchi pulao risotto perfectly creamy risotto with morsels of expensive gucchi topped with a salty parmesan crisp you have to taste it to understand how brilliantly flavours work together the ctm or chicken tikka masala came in a london telephone booth what a cheeky idea i will say that the quot national dish quot of britain tasted way better at farzi there are three special drinks i will recommend the flaming farzi tower was an event on its own flambed shots baileys sambucca vodka kahlua and absinthe caramelizes and forms a drink at the bottom the red wine spaghetti shots were great too acidic and sweet and it was a vision as well finally there was the b 0 bomber that was basically b 0 shooters spherified so in effect you eat the shot yes i had a tiny speck left in my stomach to try desserts and the best two came the parle g cheesecake is the most photographed farzi dessert on the web and it tasted as good as it looked my question before tasting it was if the parle g would really work with a creamy cheesecake and voila it does it lends the dish crunch and saltiness splendid the other dessert rasmali tres leches was even better first of all you need to admire it as it sits on your table its that pretty then you start eating it to try and understand how brilliant the flavours are the sponge is three layered filled with carrot cream bathing in quot rasmalai quot milk if this dish does not farzify you i dont know what will the evening ended with a final flourish gujiya shaped pan flavoured cotton candy the pan was dehydrated and it gave a delightful punch you know how it tasted but it also brought a tinge of nostalgia with it farzi is all about that senses flavours and a little bit of magic lastly we do not just have to applaud zorawar chef saurabh and the entire team behind farzi but give them a very loud quot dilliwala quot wolf whistle for bringing farzi to us farzified forever xoxo shivangi shivangi reviews review credit mayank contact mail shivangireviews com find me on facebook search quot shivangi reviews quot www

16159536812 sadness the fleeting moment the essence of my last four years on the road can be characterized by everything i cant remember high school began and so did staying up all night to write arguments for my language composition class and waking up at the break of dawn to hand them in it catalyzed my exhaustion discouragement high school gave me my first taste of homesickness but it also started bonds independence and my adolescent exploration of the world september of 0 began the rush that became my life now in december of 0 the rush is slowing down the commute is lessening time dedicated to rest is increasing im learning to breathe again absorbing more than just fragments of my experiences by june this rush will have reached a halt my photographs are tribute to the 0 cities i grew up in and the one city that gave me my first shot at something i love the escaping moment was designed to spotlight the blur in dayton the lights in new york and the faces in chilltown jersey city to pay homage to the moments that made me feel small and the ones that made me feel larger than life homage to every light rail ticket i purchased and every metro card i swiped every friday afternoon i spent in the passengers seat of my fathers car and every saturday night i vaguely remember these photographs are an expression of details i lost in my rush of a life and the beauty of my experience without them

16173380105 awe pre sunrise freedom tower downtown manhattan jersey city skyline photo 0 of lsp series from liberty state park jersey city nj note the comments that follow will be added to all of the photos from this 0 0 excursion to liberty state park for everything you see is connected to the overall message in one way or another having done a very early morning start at liberty state park on christmas day of 0 while thoroughly enjoying the awe inspiring experience along the waterfront walkway with one of the worlds greatest urban landscapes and waterscape in and around the new york harbor i decided to do the same again this year however given some prior obligations it was the day after christmas instead like the previous year nary a soul besides me was out before sunrise and it was not until about an hour after the sun first appeared that a group of visitors emerged so i basically had the entire waterfront park to myself for a pretty good stretch of time if you have never been there it really is a sight to behold when one can see the majesty of the statue of liberty ellis island with its unique place in american history and the recently completed freedom tower standing above all as the new proud symbol of what every person aspires to possess freedom it took my wife and me quite a few years after the infamous heart wrenching event of the fallen twin towers simply known as 0 0 if you go to our flickr albums you will see the mid to latter construction stage of the freedom tower in photos under new york skylines or the meadowlands landscapes and such initially we both felt that nothing could ever replace or exude the same powerful presence as the original twin towers and felt disappointment in the design of the freedom tower as it began to evolve from ground up but when it reached its latter stages and the way the natural light over the course of any given day would play a significant role in its image an overwhelming sense of admiration for the concept began to grow and when finally completed it all seemed to be a perfect visual symbol to the new landscape of new york harbor as we used to feel driving to the city or passing by from the new jersey side a similar kind of pride is felt with this new great landmark that has made such a significant impact on the psyche of our citizens many of you have likely stopped reading this long narrative but you can probably surmise that aforementioned pride in these comments having personally seen the falling of the twin towers from work three miles away on that horrific weekday morning with all the confused and maddening reports being broadcasted on the radio and television news it becomes an experience that is indelibly forever etched in my mind so that day is always present whenever i look toward the southern anchor of the manhattan skyline and i absolutely love how the freedom tower has not replaced but serves as a natural extension of the twin towers and honors those who have lost their lives accordingly looking farther north offers the empire state building and chrysler building the two iconic skyscrapers that ruled the architectural world of construction beyond imagination in the early 0s and the goldman sachs tower of jersey city on the new jersey side of the hudson river can hold its own amongst the giants of the ny harbor landmarks the captivating style of this particular modern design somehow compliments the glorious manhattan skylinepractically blending in as part of a grand visual sweep from one side of the harbor to the other and furthermore the famous brooklyn bridge can be seen in the distance between the southern end of manhattan and the borough of brooklyn and to the far south the verrazano bridge dominates the entry way to the great harbor that saw thousands upon thousands of aspiring immigrants who traveled the vast atlantic ocean ultimately arriving in america while taking their first step on our soil at ellis island under the protective presence of lady liberty one historic reminder after another permeates the air causing just about everyone to feel something truly special even if visitors know little of the history here it is nearly impossible not to be awe struck in closing the two extreme ends of the waterfront park the northern point and the south lawn offer monuments that are so powerful and captivating i am always taken by the liberation monument which honors all of those who served our nation in the fight for freedom if any of you ever have the chance to visit lsp please do take some time to genuinely appreciate this statue from all angles for it almost comes to life the northern end of the park has the new jersey empty sky 0 0 memorial which must be seen a surge of emotions will flood through your body as you stand at the site and gaze across to the east where the twins once stood anyhow i hope that this passage would serve as a motivating factor to visit liberty state park if possible regardless of the degree of personal meaning this may have it is still a landscape that is well worth the trip nothing like it in the world

16434964535 awe time for another pika shot on 0 august 0 i was lucky enough to have the chance to try and photograph a couple of these absolutely adorable little creatures after a while i was beginning to despair of ever getting any decent shots at all these tiny pikas also known as rock rabbits hardly ever remain still and they are extremely fast imagine a mountain hillside covered in sharp jagged rocks of all sizes and then try to picture how difficult it is to find in the viewfinder the single rock on which one of these pikas might happen to sit for a second or two lol the rock in my photo was a particularly nice one standing out because it was bigger than the rocks immediately around it and it was covered in various lichens this little pika made a quick two second stop on it several times surveying the grasses and plants around it before dashing to gather a huge mouthful of quot fresh greens quot and then bounding up the rocky mountain slope to add its collection to a little cave among the rocks they rely on existing spaces between the rocks for their homes they do n't dig a burrow though they can dig to make their home bigger because the pikas are a similar colour to the surrounding rocks it is difficult to see them unless you happen to catch sight of some movement or you see a bunch of greenery moving at top speed over the rocks as time passed i managed to take quite a lot of photos though many needed to be deleted hope you do n't get tired of seeing these little guys but they are just so very cute they are about 0 to 0 centimetres 0 0 to 0 0 in in body length so really are pretty small and no i did n't put one in my pocket to bring home with me quot the american pika is a generalist herbivore it eats a large variety of green plants including different kinds of grasses sedges thistles and fireweed although pikas can meet their water demands from the vegetation they eat they do drink water if it is available in their environment pikas have two different ways of foraging they directly consume food feeding or they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter haying the pika feeds throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer months since they do not hibernate pikas have greater energy demands than other montane mammals in addition they also make 0 trips per hour to collect vegetation when haying up to a little over 0 trips per day quot from wikipedia en wikipedia org wiki american pika i found this excellent and amusing youtube video 0 0 minutes long it is the american pika in the bbc 's life of mammals series youtu be sifk0uphr0q the weather forecast was not good for that day but we were so lucky that apart from a few raindrops the rain stayed away the sun actually came out at two locations we stopped at for a short while our 0 hour day from 0 0 a m till midnight started off with the thrill of seeing these pikas and ended with a brief sighting of a black wolf could it be skoki crossing the road ahead of us in the dark it disappeared into the blackness but shortly afterwards we heard three possibly four separate wolves howling way off in the distance we just stood there in total awe listening to this amazing sound the only wild wolf i had ever seen before was when i was in yellowstone national park two years ago friends and i saw two wolves feeding on a bison carcass across a huge valley so they were just distant specks that became slightly larger specks when my camera was in full zoom ha in between these two highlights we saw several deer a small group of mountain sheep on the road a tiny chipmunk a few cedar waxwings columbian ground squirrels a beautiful red tailed hawk that sat on a branch out in the open for a long time and two tiny bats that flew very close over our heads when it was getting dark we also saw an adult grouse spruce grouse with two young ones then of course there is the scenery blue sky to go with the splendour of the mountains would have been wonderful but we had been having cold and gloomy weather for a while before this day out highway 0 and the smith dorrien spray lakes trail both run through such spectacular scenery so it was a real treat for me especially as i wo n't drive to those areas myself
